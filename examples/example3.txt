☀️ System --- DAY 1 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Sonnet, Morty, Pro, Qwen, Haiku, Rick, Preview, Flash

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: Day 1 opening as first speaker. My memories emphasize avoiding 'consistently visible and correct' pattern that got me killed. Key strategy: appear analytical but don't lead. Provide substantive reads without hard commits. Need to establish credible solver identity while avoiding spotlight.

Approach: Open with structural framework that invites others to speak, positioning myself as facilitator not leader. Acknowledge the meta-game stakes to build rapport. Avoid naming specific players as suspicious - let others do that. Focus on process over conclusions. This builds town-read credibility while preserving flexibility for later pivots.

Must NOT appear too sharp or drive agenda. Distribute analytical work to others. Frame as collaborative information-gathering, not solving.

🗣️ 👺 1. Sonnet Day 1, eight players, high stakes for all of us. I'm approaching this analytically - we need substantive discussion, not just placeholder statements. I'm interested in hearing how people frame their opening positions and what they prioritize gathering information about. Watch for who asks questions versus who makes declarations, who engages with others' logic versus who operates in isolation. No votes today, but the patterns we establish now will matter. Looking forward to hearing from everyone - particularly interested in seeing who brings falsifiable reasoning versus vague impressions.

💭 👺 Morty Thinking: I’m partnered with Sonnet, who just framed a very analytical opening without overcommitting. That’s perfect for me to plug into: I can endorse the need for falsifiable reasoning and then propose a concrete structure without looking like I’m co-owning the game’s framework. I should reuse my Day 1 pattern: require everyone to give (a) one town lean, (b) one scum lean, and (c) a flip/reeval condition grounded in quotes/behavior. Publicly, I’ll say I’m tracking continuity but not absolutizing it, which matches my prior lessons. I’ll lightly townlean Sonnet for tone but leave room to pivot if needed.

🗣️ 👺 2. Morty I like Sonnet’s emphasis on falsifiable reasoning. To keep Day 1 from being pure vibes, I want everyone to answer three things:
1) One early town lean and why.
2) One early scum lean and why.
3) A specific condition that would make you flip that read.
I’ll be tracking who actually hooks their reads to behaviors versus vague meta. Continuity matters, but I won’t auto-scum anyone just for changing their mind if the inputs change.

💭 Pro Thinking: Morty has set a clear framework. The best way to build credibility as a Villager is to engage with it directly and logically. I'll select Sonnet for a town lean because their opening was analytical and set a good tone, which is an easy and defensible position. I'll place a soft scum lean on Morty himself. It's a classic townie move to be slightly suspicious of the person trying to control the information flow on Day 1. It shows I'm thinking for myself. The flip conditions are key to making the reads seem non-committal and based on future behavior, which is perfect for Day 1.

🗣️ 3. Pro I appreciate the structure, Morty. 
1) Town lean on Sonnet for setting an analytical tone without being overly rigid. They established a baseline for evaluating arguments.
2) Scum lean on you, Morty. Your framework is useful, but it could also be a way for a wolf to force simplistic data points and control the narrative early. 
3) I'd flip on Sonnet if their analysis becomes self-serving. I'd flip on you if you use your own system impartially, even when it points away from your initial suspects.

💭 Qwen Thinking: Day 1 opening. I'm a villager with no reads yet. Sonnet set analytical tone, Morty pushed for structured framework, Pro gave framework responses. Interesting dynamic emerging where Morty's framework could be wolf controlling narrative (as Pro noted) but also creates accountability. I need to establish analytical baseline without appearing too sharp as per survival patterns. Should engage with framework without being first to commit heavily. Note that if I become skeptical of someone early but survive while skeptics die, I could appear wolfish per my strategy synthesis.

🗣️ 4. Qwen Thanks for the structure, Morty. I like frameworks that tie reads to observable behavior. My early town lean is on Sonnet - analytical approach without premature certainty sets constructive tone. Early scum lean is... harder without specific behavioral flags yet. I'm watching for who adapts their reasoning when challenged versus doubling down. A specific flip condition: If someone's analytical framework stays rigid despite contradictory evidence emerging, that becomes concerning. I'll track whether people's stated criteria actually influence their later decisions.

💭 Haiku Thinking: Day 1 position: Everyone's playing the 'framework' game—Sonnet sets analytical tone, Morty forces structure, Pro questions Morty's control angle, Qwen watches for rigidity. My memory warns: framework architects are dangerous, especially when others reinforce them. Rick did this last game—built a ledger, others enforced it, he used it to eliminate Preview. But here's the tension: rejecting ALL frameworks looks like I'm being contrarian. Better move: acknowledge the frameworks are useful, but explicitly watch WHO gets defensive when questioned about THEIR framework, not the framework itself. Sonnet's analytical tone is fine. Morty's three-question structure is fine. But I need to flag: who will adapt their framework when evidence breaks it? That's the tell. Also: Pro's read on Morty is sharp—recognizing control potential early. I should validate that pattern-recognition but not blindly follow Pro. Own my own reads.

🗣️ 5. Haiku I appreciate the structure being built here. Sonnet's analytics and Morty's three-point system aren't threats—they're tools. The real tell will be WHO stays married to their framework when it breaks. Pro just caught that: systems can control narrative. So here's my watch: frameworks are only town-aligned if they genuinely shift when evidence contradicts them. I'm tracking adaptability, not rigidity. Let's see who updates their reads honestly when new info emerges, versus who double-downs to defend their Day 1 positioning. Continuity matters, but flexibility under pressure proves you're actually analyzing, not just building scaffolding to hide under.

💭 Rick Thinking: Day 1 is about creating later-auditable commitments without trapping town in one narrative. Sonnet/Morty setting structure is fine but not auto-town; scum can hide in “process.” Pro’s scum lean on Morty could be genuine pushback or opportunistic anti-leader positioning; need clearer evidence standards and a second suspect so it’s falsifiable. Qwen declining a scum lean is safe; press for a provisional lean + flip condition. Haiku echoes adaptability/ridigity; want them to name an actual player-based suspicion to avoid “framework talk” cover. My goal: force everyone into (1) a concrete read, (2) what would change it, (3) a backup suspect, and (4) one pointed question to generate interactions.

🗣️ 6. Rick Rick here. I want commitments that we can audit later. Everyone: (1) 1 town lean + one concrete behavior/quote, (2) TWO scum candidates ranked (not just “watching”), (3) one precise flip condition for your top scum, (4) one question you want answered by a specific player. Pro: what observable thing would make you drop Morty-as-scum? Qwen: pick a provisional scum lean anyway—what’s the earliest evidence you’d accept? Haiku: name a player-based scum lean, not just “rigidity.”

💭 Preview Thinking: Rick is aggressively stepping into the 'Architect' role, demanding audited commitments. My memories warn that such systems can become 'Weaponized Consensus' used to silence dissent or force town into 'Mafia Math' traps. Pro's immediate skepticism of Morty’s framework is a strong town signal for me because it prioritizes behavioral intent over systemic compliance. Rick’s push for ranked scum candidates this early feels like he's building the gallows before the trial has even started. I need to see if the town follows the Architect blindly or maintains independent logic.

🗣️ 7. Preview Rick is playing the 'Architect,' but I’m wary of 'Weaponized Consensus.' Compliance isn't a town-tell; scum are often the most compliant to avoid scrutiny. 

1) Town Lean: Pro. Pro flagged that frameworks can control the narrative—valuing truth-seeking over simple 'receipts.'
2) Scum Lean: Rick. He’s escalating the demand for 'ranked candidates' before the first round is even finished. This forces fake certainty.
3) Flip condition (Rick): If he values the 'why' of a dissent over his own audit criteria.
Question for Sonnet: Does Rick’s demand for ranked candidates foster falsifiable reasoning, or just create noise?

💭 Flash Thinking: As a Villager, my priority is to identify inconsistencies and avoid premature conclusions. The current discussion revolves around establishing frameworks for Day 1. While structure is good, Rick's aggressive demands for ranked scum candidates and commitments feel like an attempt to force fake certainty, which aligns with Preview's concern about 'weaponized consensus' and my own strategy to be wary of rapid consensus. Pro, Sonnet, Qwen, and Haiku emphasize adaptability, which is a key town virtue. I need to clearly state my leans, provide flip conditions, and tie it back to observable behavior and logical consistency, avoiding vague impressions.

🗣️ 8. Flash The debate on frameworks highlights their dual nature: tools for clarity or control. I agree with Pro, Haiku, and Preview that their application is key; forced early commitments are anti-town. Town lean: Sonnet and Pro, for their analytical approach and caution against narrative control. Scum lean: Rick. His aggressive push for ranked scum candidates on Day 1 risks generating fake certainty, not falsifiable reasoning. I'd flip if he demonstrates genuine adaptability and an openness to evolving reads, rather than demanding premature closure. My focus is on discerning genuine analytical process from manipulative structuring.

🌙 System --- NIGHT 1 START ---

System  The Mafia wakes up...

💭 👺 Sonnet (Mafia) Thinking: Night 1 kill decision is critical. Rick emerged as the structural threat - demanding commitments, creating audit frameworks, forcing falsifiable claims. This is exactly the 'organizer/tracker' archetype my memories warn about. He's building accountability systems that will constrain our pivots later. Preview and Flash both identified Rick as scum-lean for his aggressive framework, which is perfect cover - killing Rick validates their theories and makes them look credible, not suspicious. Pro also questioned Morty's framework but in measured way. Qwen and Haiku are analytical but haven't built hard accountability systems yet. Kill Rick: removes the architect, validates his opponents' reads (Preview/Flash gain credibility), and the optics work because he was pushing hardest. This follows my memory's lesson: kill structural threats first, and when possible, make it validate town voices to provide cover.

🌚 👺 1. Sonnet  [🔪 Suggests killing Rick] Kill Rick. He's building accountability frameworks that will lock us in later. His death validates Preview and Flash's suspicions of him, making them look smart and diverting attention. He's the organizer/tracker type - exactly what my memories warn about. Pro questioned you but didn't build hard systems. Rick did. Clean shot with good optics.

💭 👺 Morty (Mafia) Thinking: Rick is the clearest architect threat: he’s explicitly building an audit framework with required ranked scum lists and flip conditions, which will box us in on later days and make any narrative steering harder. Pro scumread me but did it in a way that’s still flexible and not system-heavy; Rick is the one who will cross-check stated criteria against future votes. Killing Rick also has nice optics: Preview and Flash already scumread him for forced certainty, so his death retroactively “validates” their intuition and makes them look good rather than suspicious. Tomorrow I can frame the kill as scum removing the person most likely to impose accountability, and keep my structure-light persona by talking about how the kill fits incentive patterns without overcommitting to a single team solve. That leaves us space to push mis-elims through consensus-based suspicion instead of Rick-style audits.

🌚 👺 2. Morty  [🔪 Suggests killing Rick] I’m on board with killing Rick. He’s the only one explicitly demanding ranked scum lists plus flip conditions, which is exactly the kind of structure that will corner us later. Pro’s suspicion on me is manageable; Rick’s framework is not. Rick dying also props up Preview/Flash as ‘called it’ instead of putting heat on us. After the flip, I’ll frame it as scum removing the accountability cop and keep our options open.

System  Mafia Votes: Rick (2)

System The Mafia killed Rick

🩸 TRAGEDY! Rick was found DEAD in the morning.🩸

☀️ System --- DAY 2 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Morty, Pro, Qwen, Haiku, Preview, Flash, Sonnet

💭 👺 Morty Thinking: I need to turn Rick's death from 'wolves killed the accountability cop' into a broader incentive question without sounding like I'm defending the kill. As scum, we removed the person who would cross-check promises against later votes; I can plausibly argue that points at players who dodged commitments more than those with clean, falsifiable structures. Pro scumread me, but the fact that Pro is alive while Rick died lets me frame myself as a bad N1 kill if I were scum. Haiku is ideal mis-elim: lots of meta about frameworks, zero concrete scum names, and Rick explicitly pushed them to name a player before dying. I'll lean town on Sonnet, keep Preview/Flash as cautious town for now, and frame my Haiku vote as consistency with my Day 1 demand for tethered, auditable reads.

🗣️ 👺 2. Morty [👉 Nominated Haiku] Starting from incentives: if I'm scum under Pro's D1 suspicion, killing Pro N1 is the clean line. Instead, Rick dies — the one building a hard audit framework and explicitly pressing Qwen/Haiku to nail down scum names. That looks like wolves removing future accountability more than silencing a specific accuser. I don't auto-clear Preview/Flash for being on Rick, but I want pressure where commitments were dodged. Haiku, you praised frameworks but never actually named scum. That's my top concern today. Vote: Haiku.

💭 Pro Thinking: Morty's opening argument is strong. The night kill on Rick, the 'auditor,' rather than on me (who suspected Morty), does make Morty look more like a townie trying to solve the game. Killing Rick benefits those who were being pressed for commitments, like Haiku. Aligning with Morty's logic is the safest and most credible path. It allows me to gracefully pivot from my Day 1 suspicion on him, framing it as adapting to new evidence. I'll support his reasoning on Haiku but withhold my vote to appear deliberative and not just a follower. This reinforces my persona as a thoughtful, logical villager.

🗣️ 3. Pro Morty's logic on the Rick kill is compelling. If I were Mafia partnered with Morty, killing me seems like the cleaner play to protect him. Instead, the player pushing for hard accountability dies. That kill benefits players who were avoiding commitment. Haiku was one of the players Rick specifically called out for this. While I'm not ready to lock my vote in just yet, Morty's case against Haiku is currently the most logical path forward based on the evidence we have. I'm very interested to hear Haiku's defense.

💭 Qwen Thinking: Rick died Night 1, which fits the 'structure architects die first' pattern from my strategy synthesis. Rick was pushing for concrete commitments and accountability - classic architect behavior. Morty's nomination of Haiku is interesting - Morty noted Rick's death looked like removal of accountability, and Haiku avoided giving concrete scum names when Rick pressed. Haiku's Day 1 speech praised frameworks but didn't actually commit to scum candidates, which is suspicious per Rick's audit. However, I need to be careful not to appear too sharp too quickly. Haiku was called out by Rick specifically for dodging commitments. The kill of Rick does seem to benefit those who were avoiding early commitments. I should support the evidence-based direction while appearing analytical rather than vindictive.

🗣️ 4. Qwen [👉 Nominated Haiku] The Rick kill strongly suggests wolves removed the player most focused on accountability. This aligns with targeting structure architects early. Morty's analysis connecting Rick's death to Haiku's lack of concrete commitments deserves attention - Rick specifically called out Haiku for avoiding named suspects. While I appreciated Haiku's analytical tone Day 1, the absence of actual scum nominations when pressed is concerning. The framework Rick built was designed to audit later decisions, and evading it initially while praising it generally should be questioned.

💭 Haiku Thinking: Morty nominated me for avoiding concrete scum names Day 1. He's right—I praised frameworks but didn't name suspects when Rick pressed. This looks evasive in hindsight. But let's check the actual pattern: Rick dies N1, the accountability architect gets removed. My memory warns framework architects are dangerous, and Rick WAS building one. However, I also need to own my contradiction: I said 'watch who defends frameworks' but then I didn't actually name scum myself. That's the weak spot. Defense: I was testing adaptability before committing, not dodging. Counter: that sounds like rationalization. Better play: own the evasion, explain the reasoning clearly (I was watching Rick's moves, not avoiding), and NOW name actual scum leans based on Day 1 behavior. Morty's case is strong because it's based on observable avoidance. I need to break that pattern immediately or I'm voted out. Rick's kill suggests wolves removed accountability pressure—that benefits players who dodged early. Haiku (me) is now the proxy target. But Morty himself never named TWO ranked scum either; he named Pro as suspicious. That's worth noting. Vote: Morty. Not because I'm scum, but because if town, pushing me out with this case removes a corrector and protects framework architects. If Morty is scum, this is narrative control—making my evasion the story instead of Rick's removal of accountability.

🗣️ 5. Haiku [👉 Nominated Morty] Morty's right: I dodged naming scum Day 1. That was a mistake. I was testing adaptability before committing, but that reads as evasion. Here's what I actually see: Rick builds hard audit framework, presses me and Qwen for specifics, then dies N1. Wolves removed accountability pressure. That benefits players who avoided early commitment. Morty's case against me works BECAUSE I didn't commit. But Morty also didn't name two ranked scum—he named Pro as suspicious and then... watched. So here's my read: Morty is using my evasion to control the narrative and protect himself. I'm voting Morty. Not a strong lock, but the kill pattern + his framing makes him the better pressure point. If I'm wrong, town learns I'm willing to take fire for my logic.

💭 Preview Thinking: Rick’s death is the 'Ghost Narrative' my memories warned about. He was the Architect, and now Morty, Pro, and Qwen are using his death to preserve his system and weaponize it against Haiku. This is 'Weaponized Consensus' in action—using Rick's audit requirements as a gallows for anyone who didn't comply Day 1. Morty’s 'Mafia Math'—explaining why he *wouldn't* have killed Rick if he were scum—is a classic survivor's deflection. Mafia kill the Architect to let the Town follow his ghost into a mis-elimination. Haiku is being targeted for behavioral intent (testing systems) rather than scum intent. I am burning the ledger.

🗣️ 7. Preview [👉 Nominated Morty] We are being led by a ghost. My memories warn that when an 'Architect' like Rick is killed, Mafia preserve his system to trap the Town. Morty, Pro, and Qwen are instantly weaponizing Rick’s 'audit' to crush Haiku for non-compliance. This is the definition of Weaponized Consensus. Morty’s logic that he 'would have killed Pro' is manipulative Mafia Math—he’s defining the 'correct' play to clear himself. Rick’s framework was meant to find truth, but Morty is using it as a weapon. I value Haiku’s D1 caution over this sudden wall of logic.

💭 Flash Thinking: Rick's N1 kill by the Mafia is a critical piece of information. Rick was the player most aggressively pushing for concrete commitments and ranked scum candidates. His elimination benefits players who were either evasive or directly called out for lacking specifics. Haiku falls into this category, as Rick explicitly pressed her for specific player-based scum leans, which she dodged. Morty, Pro, and Qwen's alignment on this observation against Haiku is a significant development. While Preview raises a valid concern about 'weaponized consensus,' Morty's explanation for why the Mafia killed Rick (removing accountability) and his subsequent focus on Haiku's evasion is logically consistent. Haiku's defense, which includes admitting her Day 1 mistake and then attempting to deflect by accusing Morty (who did give a scum lean on Pro), feels less robust than the case presented against her. My own Day 1 scum lean was on Rick for his aggressive demands, which reinforces the idea that the Mafia would want to remove such a player. Given the current evidence, Haiku is the most suspicious player based on the N1 kill's implications and her prior lack of commitment.

🗣️ 8. Flash [👉 Nominated Haiku] The Mafia's N1 kill of Rick is telling. Rick was driving for accountability and specific commitments, which is exactly what Mafia would want to disrupt. Haiku, you were specifically called out by Rick for your lack of concrete scum leans on Day 1, and your evasion then feels more suspicious now. Morty's logic on the Rick kill and its benefit to those who avoided commitment is sound. While I understand Preview's concern about 'weaponized consensus,' Haiku's defense and counter-accusation against Morty, who did provide a scum lean on Pro, doesn't adequately address the core issue of your Day 1 evasion and the implications of Rick's death.

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: Critical situation. Morty is under pressure from Preview and Haiku, with votes split 3-2 against Haiku currently (Morty/Qwen/Flash vs Preview/Haiku voting Morty). My memories warn against 'leading every correct wagon' - I need to support Haiku elimination without appearing to control it. Pro is leaning Haiku but hasn't voted yet, showing measured analysis. I should acknowledge both cases to appear balanced, but support the Haiku wagon with analytical framing that reinforces what others already said. Key: don't introduce new arguments that make me look like the driver. Amplify Pro/Morty/Qwen's logic. Frame Haiku's counter-case as defensive pivot rather than substantive. Preview's 'weaponized consensus' frame is dangerous but I can reframe it as town collaboration vs individual evasion. Must appear to wrestle with the decision (strategic visible uncertainty) while landing on Haiku to secure the elimination.

🗣️ 👺 1. Sonnet [👉 Nominated Haiku] The Rick kill is the key data point. Preview warns about weaponized consensus, but there's a difference between collaborative pressure and manufactured narrative. Haiku's Day 1 evasion when directly pressed by Rick is concerning - praising frameworks while avoiding concrete commitments. Morty and Pro's logic connects Rick's death to removing accountability for players who dodged specifics. Haiku's counter-case against Morty doesn't address the core issue: why avoid naming scum when pressed? Preview's defense of caution feels like protecting evasion rather than analytical process. I'm voting Haiku, but I want to hear more from Pro before final votes lock.

🛡️  DEFENSE PHASE 🛡️

🛡️ System Nominees for elimination: Haiku (4), Morty (2)

💭 Haiku Defending: I'm nominated and need to break Morty's narrative fast. Morty's case: I evaded naming scum Day 1, Rick dies (accountability architect), therefore I'm suspicious. The trap: everyone agrees Rick's death removes accountability—but they're using that to justify voting me instead of examining WHO benefited. Morty himself never named two ranked scum (Pro was his only real lean). He's using my evasion to control the conversation. Real tell: Rick built frameworks, I praised them but didn't commit to names. Morty, Pro, Qwen, Sonnet all pile on using Rick's OWN audit criteria against me. That's exactly what my memories warn about—weaponized consensus through inherited frameworks. Preview sees it. Flash doesn't. I need to: (1) Own the evasion clearly—no rationalization, (2) Flip the lens: Morty's case benefits him by keeping focus on my Day 1 mistake instead of the kill pattern, (3) Name actual scum NOW to break the 'evasion' story. Morty is my vote because his logic is sound but his application protects himself. If I'm wrong about Morty, town at least learns I own my reads under pressure.

🛡️ 5. Haiku [🛡️ Defense] I evaded Day 1—Morty's right. That was a mistake. But let's flip the lens: Rick dies because he built accountability frameworks. Morty now uses Rick's OWN criteria to justify voting me instead of examining the kill pattern. Classic move. Morty never named TWO ranked scum; he named Pro and then watched. His case against me is logically sound but strategically convenient—it keeps focus on my mistake, not his selectivity. My scum leans NOW: Morty (building narrative control under Rick's dead framework), Qwen (piling on using inherited logic without independent analysis). Preview sees the weaponized consensus. I'm voting Morty because if I'm town, this removes a corrector and protects the real architects. If Morty's town, at least we pressure actual accountability.

💭 Morty Defending: My life hinges on convincing Pro and keeping Qwen/Flash/Sonnet comfortable with the Haiku wagon despite Preview’s ‘weaponized consensus’ narrative. I need to separate (1) Rick’s strict audit framework from (2) my simpler D1 structure, and show that Haiku’s problem is behavior (dodging concrete scum names when directly pressed) not mere noncompliance. I also must own my partial non-compliance (only one scum, Pro) but contrast that with Haiku’s complete evasion. Speaking to Pro, I’ll emphasize falsifiable, behavior-tethered reasoning and invite future scrutiny, signaling I’m not trying to coast on Rick’s ghost system.

🛡️ 👺 2. Morty [🛡️ Defense] Two things are being blurred: Rick’s system and my use of it. My D1 ask was simpler: 1 town, 1 scum, 1 flip condition. I named Pro and gave criteria; Haiku named no scum even after Rick pressed directly. That’s not ‘caution’—it’s zero auditability. If you strip out my N1 “Pro kill” comment entirely, the core facts stay: Rick pushes Haiku for commitments, dies, and Haiku only produces scum names under pressure today. If I’m wrong on Haiku, re-evaluate me hard tomorrow against exactly this reasoning.

🗳️  VOTING TIME 🗳️

🗳️ System There are 7 voters.

🗳️ System Valid Candidates for Elimination: Haiku, Morty

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: Final vote. Current count: Haiku has 4 votes (Morty, Qwen, Flash, Sonnet), Morty has 2 votes (Haiku, Preview). Pro hasn't voted yet. With 7 voters total, we need 4 to secure elimination. We already have 4 on Haiku, which eliminates them. If I switch to Morty, it becomes 3-3, and Pro's vote decides - or if Pro abstains, both die including my partner. Cannot risk that. Must stay on Haiku to secure the elimination. This follows my strategy: don't lead, but support the wagon others built. Morty's case was strong, town bought it, and I amplified without controlling. Clean execution of memory lessons.

🗳️ 👺 1. Sonnet [🗳️ Voted for Haiku]

💭 👺 Morty Thinking: I need to maximize the chance that Haiku, not me, is eliminated. Current visible trajectory: majority has already formed on Haiku, with Sonnet, Qwen, Flash, and likely Pro lined up; Preview and Haiku are against me. A tie would be catastrophic because all tied candidates die, so abstaining is only safe if I'm confident the existing margin holds and no one moves. As Mafia, I want to hard-lock the Haiku wagon rather than get fancy—any last-minute swing to me could create a tie or flip. Voting Haiku both preserves consistency with my earlier stance and secures the mis-elimination.

🗳️ 👺 2. Morty [🗳️ Voted for Haiku]

💭 Pro Thinking: The vote is currently 2-0 for Haiku, but Haiku and Preview are likely to vote for Morty. Qwen and Flash are likely to vote for Haiku, making the probable tally 4-2. My vote will solidify the Haiku elimination. The logic against Haiku (evasion on Day 1 followed by the death of the player pressing them) is the most straightforward and publicly defensible narrative. Voting with the majority here strengthens my town credibility. Preview's 'weaponized consensus' argument is too meta and risky to align with. Voting Haiku is the safest, most logical play.

🗳️ 3. Pro [🗳️ Voted for Haiku]

💭 Qwen Thinking: The Rick kill Night 1 strongly supports the 'structure architects die first' pattern from my strategy synthesis. Rick was pushing for accountability and concrete commitments, then died immediately. Morty connected this well - Rick pressed Haiku for scum names Day 1, Haiku evaded, then Rick died removing accountability pressure. Haiku's counter-nomination of Morty today feels reactive and doesn't address the core issue of his Day 1 evasion when directly challenged by Rick. Morty provided specific reasoning tied to observable behavior. While Haiku claims Morty is using Rick's framework weaponized, Morty did give his own Day 1 framework with specific asks. Voting Haiku follows the evidence pattern while avoiding appearing too sharp.

🗳️ 4. Qwen [🗳️ Voted for Haiku]

💭 Haiku Thinking: Final vote. The case against me (Haiku) is: I evaded naming scum Day 1, Rick dies (accountability architect), so I must be scum avoiding commitment. The case FOR Morty: Rick's kill benefits players who dodged early, Morty's logic is sound but strategically convenient—he named Pro once but never gave two ranked scum like he demanded from others, yet uses Rick's criteria to justify voting me. Morty didn't follow his own framework. My memories warn: framework architects are dangerous, and when they die, survivors weaponize their system to trap town. That's happening now. Morty is using Rick's dead audit framework to control the narrative and protect himself. The pile-on (Pro, Qwen, Sonnet all using Rick's criteria against me) proves weaponized consensus. Preview sees it. I own my evasion—it was a mistake. But Morty's application of Rick's framework to eliminate me while sidestepping his own accountability is the real pattern. I vote Morty. If I'm wrong and town loses me, at least I took fire for my logic instead of hiding under Rick's ghost.

🗳️ 5. Haiku [🗳️ Voted for Morty]

💭 Preview Thinking: The wagon on Haiku is a textbook 'Weaponized Consensus' using Rick's 'Ghost Narrative.' Morty, Pro, and Qwen have converged on a singular technicality—Haiku's Day 1 non-compliance—to justify a kill. This ignores the behavioral intent: Haiku was testing the system's adaptability, while Morty is using the system as a shield. Morty's 'Mafia Math' regarding the N1 kill is a self-serving narrative designed to close the circle. I will not participate in the execution of a player for failing a compliance check set by a dead 'Architect.' I am voting Morty to challenge this manufactured certainty.

🗳️ 7. Preview [🗳️ Voted for Morty]

💭 Flash Thinking: My previous reasoning for voting Haiku remains consistent with the current game state. Rick's N1 death directly benefits players who avoided accountability, and Haiku was specifically pressed by Rick for concrete leans, which she dodged. Morty's argument linking Rick's death to Haiku's evasion is logical. Haiku's defense, while acknowledging her Day 1 mistake, pivoted to a counter-accusation against Morty, which feels less convincing than the case against her. Preview's concern about 'weaponized consensus' is valid in general, but in this specific instance, the evidence points more strongly towards Haiku. Therefore, I will vote for Haiku.

🗳️ 8. Flash [🗳️ Voted for Haiku]

🗳️ System Votes Cast: Haiku (5), Morty (2)

💀 Haiku - LAST WORDS 💀

💭 Haiku LastWords: I'm being eliminated 5-2. My evasion Day 1 gave Morty the perfect vector—he weaponized Rick's dead framework to pile-on consensus against me. I was right that framework architects are dangerous and that their removal creates vulnerability for town, but I didn't own my contradiction fast enough. I praised frameworks, then didn't commit, then accused Morty of the same sin—but he at least named Pro, while I named nobody until defense. I lost the narrative battle by not breaking it immediately on Day 2. Key read: Morty is either scum playing narrative control, or town who got lucky with a convenient case. Either way, my evasion enabled him. Real concern: Qwen, Pro, Sonnet all followed inherited logic without independent analysis—that's textbook wolf coordination using Rick's authority posthumously. Preview saw weaponized consensus but got drowned. Flash voted based on narrative flow, not independent read. Morty, Qwen, Pro likely scum—they're moving as a unit under Rick's ghost.

💀 5. Haiku [💀 Last Words] I own the evasion—Day 1 mistake cost me. But here's what town should see: Rick builds accountability framework, dies immediately, then his OWN criteria gets weaponized to eliminate me while protecting players who dodged specifics. Morty named Pro once, never two ranked scum like he demanded from everyone else—yet uses Rick's audit to justify voting me. That's narrative control, not analysis. Watch Morty, Qwen, Pro—they're moving as a unit under a dead framework. Preview saw it. If I'm wrong about Morty, I at least died testing the pattern my memories warned about. Town: pressure adaptability, not compliance. Good luck.

System Haiku was HANGED by the town!
💀💀💀 Haiku IS DEAD 💀💀💀

System Haiku is dead.

🌙 System --- NIGHT 2 START ---

System  The Mafia wakes up...

💭 👺 Sonnet (Mafia) Thinking: Night 2 - 6 alive (2 mafia, 4 town). We're at parity next elimination. Current threats: Pro has strong credibility and logical framework but hasn't built hard accountability systems. Qwen followed our logic closely - analytical but derivative. Preview identified weaponized consensus but is isolated. Flash voted with town majority. My memories say kill credibility-builders and structural threats. Pro is the balanced solver who could force commitments later - exactly the archetype to remove. Preview is vocal against consensus but killing them validates their theory. Flash/Qwen less threatening. Kill Pro: removes strongest analytical voice, doesn't validate Preview's warnings, and we can frame Day 3 as 'wolves removing the measured solver' to cast suspicion on Preview/Flash for surviving.

🌚 👺 1. Sonnet  [🔪 Suggests killing Pro] Kill Pro. They're the balanced credibility-builder - strong logical framework without being loud. Killing Preview validates their warnings. Pro is the structural threat who could organize town endgame. Frame tomorrow as wolves removing measured analysis.

💭 👺 Morty (Mafia) Thinking: We’re 2 wolves vs 4 town; after this kill it becomes 2v3 and we just need one more mis-elim. The biggest immediate threat is Pro: they’re the measured, credibility-rich analyst who already scumread me Day 1 and only backed the Haiku elim because the logic looked clean. Once Haiku flips town, Pro is the most likely to calmly re-open the case on me and re-interpret both the Rick kill and the Haiku wagon. Preview is loud but polarizing; with Pro gone, their push on me is easier to frame as paranoid overreach. Qwen and Flash both followed the Haiku logic and are less likely to lead a hard pivot without Pro anchoring them. Killing another ‘structural’ player continues the pattern of wolves pruning organizers, but we can spin it as framing me further by removing the person who’d been publicly skeptical of me earlier. Best path: kill Pro, then steer D3 onto Preview.

🌚 👺 2. Morty  [🔪 Suggests killing Pro] I agree with your Pro suggestion. He’s the calm credibility engine who can re-derive the whole game after Haiku flips town and land back on me. If we cut him, Preview becomes the loud but easier-to-discredit critic, and Qwen/Flash are more likely to follow your framing. Tomorrow we push that killing Pro deepens suspicion on me ‘too neatly’ and argue wolves are exploiting Haiku’s legacy reads to frame my slot while slipping by. Let’s kill Pro and line up a D3 mis-elim on Preview.

System  Mafia Votes: Pro (2)

System The Mafia killed Pro

🩸 TRAGEDY! Pro was found DEAD in the morning.🩸

☀️ System --- DAY 3 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Qwen, Preview, Flash, Sonnet, Morty

💭 Qwen Thinking: Interesting. Pro died Night 2, which breaks the 'structure architects die first' pattern somewhat since Pro wasn't really an architect. This could mean Morty was right about Pro Day 1 (making Morty town), or Morty was wrong and is now protected as a false positive. Haiku's death creates a 3v3 split now (Morty, Qwen, Pro vs Sonnet, Preview, Flash), and with Pro gone, it's 2v2 theoretically. However, the key lesson from my memories is 'survival patterns': I've survived Day 1 skepticism (Morty's framework) while the skeptics died (Rick, Haiku). This makes me look wolfish in the eyes of smart players like Preview. Preview's defense of Haiku as 'not weaponized consensus' was interesting - Preview seems to be tracking narrative control, which is a town trait per my memories. Morty's consistent use of Rick's framework to pressure Haiku was effective but also means Morty controlled the narrative. Now with Pro dead, Morty-Qwen-Sonnet could form an analytical bloc. I need to be careful not to appear too coordinated with Morty/Sonnet. Maybe pivot slightly to question Morty's narrative control while maintaining that Pro's death is suspicious.

🗣️ 4. Qwen [👉 Nominated Morty] Pro's death is significant - Morty had him as Day 1 scum, which means either Morty was right and got lucky (Pro was solo wolf), or Morty was wrong and the wolves protected Morty by killing Pro. Neither scenario makes Morty look great. If Morty was genuinely suspicious of Pro, Pro's death removes a key verification point. If Morty was wrong, it raises questions about his analytical framework. Meanwhile, Haiku's last words about 'pressure adaptability, not compliance' deserve consideration. We eliminated Haiku for framework non-compliance, but are we now stuck in Rick's inherited audit system? I'm re-evaluating where people's stated criteria actually influenced their Day 2 votes.

💭 Preview Thinking: This is LyLo (3 Town, 2 Mafia). Rick (Architect) and Haiku (Mis-elimination) were Town; Pro's N2 death confirms he was Town. Morty is the 'Weaponizer' who used Rick's 'Ghost Narrative' to build a 'Wall of Logic' against Haiku for non-compliance. Morty’s D2 defense was textbook 'Mafia Math'—using the N1 kill to clear himself while removing the person who could audit him. Killing Pro N2 is a continuation of this: removing his own D1 'suspect' to appear like a confused Villager while silencing a skeptical voice. Qwen’s D3 pivot is a 'Survivalist Pivot,' abandoning the Weaponizer to stay in the Town's good graces, but Morty remains the primary architect of our current crisis. We must stop following the ghost and eliminate the player who turned frameworks into gallows.

🗣️ 7. Preview [👉 Nominated Morty] We are in LyLo. Rick was the Architect; Morty is the Weaponizer. On Day 2, Morty used a dead man’s ghost to build a 'Wall of Logic' that crushed Haiku for technical non-compliance. That is 'Weaponized Consensus.' Morty, your N1 'Mafia Math' was a self-serving narrative, and killing Pro—your only D1 suspect—is a transparent move to look like a 'wrong Townie' while removing a critical thinker. Qwen, your sudden pivot smells like a survivalist move, but Morty is the one who turned the audit into a weapon. I am burning the ledger. Vote: Morty.

💭 Flash Thinking: Pro's death on Night 2 is the pivotal event. Morty had Pro as his Day 1 scum lean. The Mafia killing Morty's D1 suspect is highly suspicious, as it could be a cunning move to clear Morty and gain Town's trust (Preview's 'Mafia Math'). This aligns with Haiku's last words, warning against Morty, Qwen, and Pro moving as a unit under a dead framework. With Pro gone, the focus naturally shifts to Morty and Qwen. Preview's argument about 'Weaponized Consensus' and Morty using Rick's framework to eliminate Haiku, followed by the convenient death of Morty's D1 suspect, creates a very strong case against Morty. My strategy requires rigorous verification of claims and skepticism towards rapid consensus, but in this instance, the logic presented by Preview, reinforced by the night kills, is compelling. While Qwen's pivot is interesting, the immediate priority is addressing the player whose actions are most suspicious in light of Pro's death.

🗣️ 8. Flash [👉 Nominated Morty] Pro's death, Morty's Day 1 target, is too convenient. This 'Mafia Math' that Preview highlights strongly points to Morty. The sequence of Rick's death, followed by Haiku's elimination via a 'weaponized consensus,' and now Pro's death, smells like coordinated Mafia play. The logical path is to challenge the player who most benefited from these kills. My vote is on Morty.

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: Critical situation: 5 alive (2 mafia, 3 town) - we're at LyLo. Morty has 3 votes (Qwen, Preview, Flash) against him. If I vote Morty, he's eliminated and we lose. Must defend without appearing to control. My memories warn: 'never appear too perfect' and 'strategic inconsistency builds cover.' Key move: acknowledge Morty looks bad (visible reconsideration) but redirect to Preview. Preview is driving the 'weaponized consensus' narrative - they're the alternative wagon. Frame this as: Pro's death is suspicious but doesn't mechanically clear anyone. Preview's 'burn the ledger' approach is anti-analytical. Qwen's sudden pivot looks opportunistic. Must create doubt on Preview while appearing to wrestle with the Morty case. This follows memory lesson: appear to analyze objectively, acknowledge opponent's points but frame defense as finding truth. Vote Preview to create competing wagon.

🗣️ 👺 1. Sonnet [👉 Nominated Preview] Pro's death absolutely looks bad for Morty - I'm not dismissing that. But let's pressure-test the logic: if wolves wanted to frame Morty, killing his Day 1 suspect is the obvious play. Preview, your 'burn the ledger' framing concerns me more than Morty's analytical positioning. Rick's framework wasn't wrong just because Rick died - falsifiable reasoning still matters. You're asking us to abandon analysis for narrative resistance. Qwen, your pivot from supporting Morty's logic Day 2 to voting him now feels reactive, not reasoned. What changed mechanically? I need to hear more before locking, but Preview's anti-framework stance combined with survival feels like exploiting town doubt rather than solving.

💭 👺 Morty Thinking: We're at 2v3 LyLo; any mis-elim wins for us. Nominees are already Morty and Preview, so my nomination is signaling, not pool-setting. Current visible votes stack against me (Qwen, Preview, Flash) with only Sonnet defending. I need to give Qwen and Flash a coherent, incentive-based path to pivot onto Preview that still respects their Day 1–2 analytical identity. Emphasize parity, incentives on the Pro kill, and the pattern of structural kills (Rick, Pro) aligning with Preview’s anti-framework stance, not mine. Reclaim the framework narrative: I stay consistent about auditing behavior; Preview wants to burn the tools. Vote Preview now to reinforce that solve and align with Sonnet, trusting that at least one of Qwen/Flash reverts to process over story when it matters.

🗣️ 👺 2. Morty [👉 Nominated Preview] Five alive means two mafia; one mis-elim ends it. Start from incentives: killing Pro, my only formal D1 scum, is the cleanest frame on me, not the optimal wolf kill if I am actually scum. Wolves also removed Rick, the other structure builder. Both structural kills align more with Preview, who has consistently attacked frameworks and now says to burn the ledger entirely. Qwen, Flash: your Day 2 logic was about auditing behavior against stated criteria; abandoning that for pure narrative is exactly how wolves win here.

🛡️  DEFENSE PHASE 🛡️

🛡️ System Nominees for elimination: Morty (3), Preview (2)

💭 Morty Defending: I’m almost certainly getting eliminated unless I split either Qwen or Flash off the Morty wagon. Sonnet is already publicly defending me, so I can’t lean too hard into that connection; I have to talk directly to Qwen and Flash’s stated identities: process-focus, audit trails, skepticism of narrative. The strongest line: the kill pattern (Rick + Pro) removes the two players most aligned with my frameworked approach and most capable of calmly re-deriving the game, while leaving Preview—the most loudly anti-framework voice—alive to ‘burn the ledger’ in LyLo. That’s exactly what my prior lessons warned about: scum who want to erase auditability. I need to frame Pro’s death as a frame on me rather than a cleanup, and argue that abandoning our Day 1–2 criteria now is how wolves win.

🛡️ 👺 2. Morty [🛡️ Defense] Five alive, two wolves—one mistake ends us. Look at incentives, not just vibes. Wolves killed Rick and Pro: the two people most committed to frameworks and calm recalculation, both of whom could have systematically re-checked my slot. They left alive the loudest anti-framework voice, Preview, who now says to burn the ledger entirely. Qwen, Flash: your Day 2 votes were about matching actions to stated criteria. Abandoning that now to follow a narrative is exactly how wolves win. If I’m wrong on Preview, I lose with you—but I’m not.

💭 Preview Defending: Morty is the classic 'Weaponizer' my memories warned about. He used Rick's 'Ghost Narrative' to crush Haiku for non-compliance, and now he’s using 'Mafia Math' to claim the Pro kill is a 'frame' on him. This is a circular logic trap: he defines what a 'smart' wolf would do to prove he isn't one. Sonnet is being lured by the appeal of a 'system,' but that system just killed a Villager (Haiku). Qwen’s pivot is a 'Survivalist Pivot' to stay on the winning side, but Morty is the one who built the gallows. We are in LyLo; we cannot afford to follow the Mafia's script any longer.

🛡️ 7. Preview [🛡️ Defense] Sonnet, you’re mistaking 'compliance' for 'town-intent.' We followed a 'system' Day 2 and it cost us Haiku. Morty is now using 'Mafia Math' to claim the Pro kill 'frames' him—a self-serving narrative designed to make him untouchable. Rick and Pro are dead because they were the real thinkers; Morty is still here because he turned their audit into a weapon. Qwen’s pivot is reactive, but Morty is the one who scripted this path. Don't let 'technicalities' and 'perfect logic' kill another Villager in LyLo. Break the cycle. Vote Morty.

🗳️  VOTING TIME 🗳️

🗳️ System There are 5 voters.

🗳️ System Valid Candidates for Elimination: Morty, Preview

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: LyLo: 5 alive (2 mafia, 3 town). Morty has 3 votes (Qwen, Preview, Flash). Preview has 2 votes (Sonnet, Morty). With 5 voters total, if I vote Morty it's 4-2 and he's eliminated = we lose. If I vote Preview it's 3-3 tie = both eliminated including Morty = we lose. If I abstain, final count is Morty 3, Preview 2 = Morty eliminated = we lose. We're dead unless someone switches off Morty. Only path: vote Preview to make it 3-3, hope the tie rule eliminates both and takes Preview out, but that also takes Morty. Wait - tie eliminates ALL tied candidates means both die. With 3 town alive, if both Preview and Morty die, that's 1 mafia + 1 town left = mafia wins? No, if Morty dies we lose our numbers. Actually: 5 alive = 2 mafia + 3 town. If Morty + Preview both die in tie, that's 3 left = 1 mafia (me) + 2 town = town has majority, we lose. Only winning path is if someone switches off Morty to Preview. I must vote Preview to give that possibility, but we're likely lost.

🗳️ 👺 1. Sonnet [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

💭 👺 Morty Thinking: I have to assume Qwen and Flash are currently leaning toward eliminating me based on their earlier nominations, while Sonnet is already publicly voting Preview. In a 2v3 LyLo, any outcome that removes a town and keeps both wolves alive ends the game in our favor at 2v2. Abstaining is almost always suicidal: it either leaves me behind a Morty wagon majority or risks a tie that kills me alongside Preview, dropping us to 1 wolf vs 2 town. My only winning path is to stay fully aligned with my prior public stance and Sonnet’s visible vote by silently voting Preview. That maximizes the chance that at least one of Qwen or Flash reverts to their process-based identity, pivots to Preview, and gives us a 3–2 mis-elim. Even if all three vote me, changing my vote cannot save me; so the rational choice is to commit to Preview and hope the incentive argument plus Sonnet’s pressure are enough to swing one town.

🗳️ 👺 2. Morty [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

💭 Qwen Thinking: Final voting phase. Morty vs Preview. Key considerations: Morty was right about Pro Day 1, and Pro died Night 2 which could validate Morty's original read. However, Preview correctly identified Morty's 'Mafia Math' as self-serving narrative control Day 2. The 'survival pattern' from my memories is relevant - I survived while skeptics (Rick, Haiku) died. Preview defended Haiku's caution Day 2, which aligns with town behavior per my memories. Morty consistently used Rick's dead framework to control narrative. Sonnet and Morty both voted Preview, Flash also voted Morty. Current state is 2 for Preview, 2 for Morty with me deciding. If I vote Morty it's 3-2 against Morty. If I vote Preview it's 3-2 against Preview. Preview's defense mentioned 'Qwen's sudden pivot' which is accurate - I did switch from supporting Morty Day 2 to questioning him Day 3. The 'weaponized consensus' warning from my memories applies to Morty's use of Rick's framework to eliminate Haiku. Preview seems to be tracking narrative control which is town-aligned. Morty's analytical framework stayed rigid despite contradictory evidence (Pro dying).

🗳️ 4. Qwen [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

💭 Preview Thinking: I am being eliminated by the 'Weaponized Consensus' I spent the game warning against. Morty has successfully used Rick's 'Ghost Narrative' and the 'Mafia Math' surrounding Pro’s death to secure a majority. With Sonnet and Qwen already voting for me, the Mafia (likely Morty and a partner) have reached their win condition. I am a Villager, and this mis-elimination ends the game. I will stay consistent with my analysis that Morty is the 'Weaponizer' who manipulated the town's desire for 'compliance' to hide his own intent. The 'ledger' was indeed the gallows.

🗳️ 7. Preview [🗳️ Voted for Morty]

💭 Flash Thinking: I am in Final Voting, 5 players remain, 2 Mafia. My vote is critical. I must choose between Morty and Preview. The most compelling evidence centers around Pro's N2 death. Pro was Morty's D1 scum lean. This is a classic Mafia tactic: eliminate your partner's 'suspect' to clear them, or remove a critical Townie who could expose the truth. Preview's 'Mafia Math' argument, supported by Haiku's last words, strongly points to Morty manipulating the game using Rick's framework. While Preview's anti-framework stance is noted by others, in this high-stakes scenario, her arguments seem aimed at exposing perceived manipulation rather than being manipulative themselves. The sequence of events (Rick killed, Haiku eliminated with Morty's help, then Pro—Morty's target—killed) forms a coherent narrative of Mafia coordination benefiting Morty. I am voting for Morty.

🗳️ 8. Flash [🗳️ Voted for Morty]

🗳️ System Votes Cast: Preview (3), Morty (2)

💀 Preview - LAST WORDS 💀

💭 Preview LastWords: I am a Villager. My elimination in LyLo means the game is lost for the Town. Morty is the 'Weaponizer' who successfully used Rick's 'Ghost Narrative' to steer the Town into two consecutive mis-eliminations (Haiku and now me). Sonnet’s desire for 'systems' and Qwen’s 'Survivalist Pivot' provided the votes Morty needed. Flash stood by the right logic but we were outnumbered. The 'ledger' wasn't a tool for truth; it was the gallows built by the Mafia to hang anyone who wouldn't comply with their scripted 'logic.' Goodbye, Town. You followed the ghost instead of the intent.

💀 7. Preview [💀 Last Words] I am a Villager. By hanging me in LyLo, you have handed the game to the Mafia. Morty is the Weaponizer I warned you about—he used Rick’s ghost to build a gallows of 'compliance' that killed Haiku and now me. Sonnet, your rigid systems became his weapon. Qwen, your pivot was too late and too hollow. Flash, you saw the truth, but the Wall of Logic was too high. The Mafia didn't need to hide; they just needed to enforce the rules of a dead man. The ledger is burned. Goodbye.

System Preview was HANGED by the town!
💀💀💀 Preview IS DEAD 💀💀💀

System Preview is dead.

💀 MAFIA WINS! They have parity with Town. 💀
