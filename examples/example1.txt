☀️ System --- DAY 1 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Rick, Flash, Preview, Sonnet, Pro, Morty, Haiku, Qwen

💭 Rick Thinking: Day 1 with no votes: maximize future-auditable commitments. Push each player to give a named lean (town/scum) with a specific reason tied to behavior, plus one thing that would change their mind tomorrow. This creates falsifiability and discourages narrative-spinning. Watch for agenda-setting (preloading “X is probably scum later”), buddying, and non-checkable answers. Distribute pressure to avoid scum hiding in consensus. Since I speak once, I’ll set a structured prompt for everyone, call out low-information theory talk, and ask quieter players for concrete stances. No reads yet; focus on process and commitments.

🗣️ 1. Rick Town: let’s lock in Day 1 commitments. Each of you (Flash, Preview, Sonnet, Pro, Morty, Haiku, Qwen) reply with:
1) One strongest town lean + why (quote/behavior).
2) One strongest scum lean + why.
3) One specific thing that would flip your scum lean tomorrow.
No “too early” answers—pick anyway, even if weak. Also: if you suspect someone, name the exact behavior you expect to see change Day 2. I’ll be tracking who provides falsifiable reasons vs. vibes.

💭 Flash Thinking: Rick has set a good standard for Day 1. As a Villager, my priority is to genuinely help town. I need to provide clear, actionable leans based on initial observations. I'll lean town on Rick for providing a good structure. For scum, I'll choose someone whose future actions can be easily monitored. The flip condition must be specific and observable. My overall goal is to establish myself as a credible town player from the start, avoiding any behavior that could be misinterpreted as scummy or unhelpful. It's crucial to give a well-reasoned response.

🗣️ 2. Flash Rick, I appreciate the structured approach for Day 1, it helps focus discussion. My strongest town lean is Rick himself, for setting a clear expectation. My weakest scum lean, purely due to the 'no early' rule, is Qwen. Their lack of immediate input could be a tell, or just them processing. If Qwen actively engages with thoughtful analysis tomorrow, contributing proactively rather than reactively, it would flip my scum lean.

💭 Preview Thinking: Rick is establishing himself as the 'Spine' I noted in my strategy. By forcing commitments, he's creating a paper trail. Flash's immediate compliance and leaning Town on Rick is a classic 'Echo' and 'Safe Play.' He’s buddying the loudest voice early. I need to fulfill Rick’s request to avoid being a distraction, while testing the waters. I'll lean Town on Rick for the initiative and scum lean on Flash for the overly-compliant 'echoing' behavior which often masks Mafia trying to blend in. For Qwen, I'll watch for her consistency as my strategy suggests she’s often reliable Town when she uses logic over theories.

🗣️ 3. Preview Rick, I’ll play along; setting a baseline is vital for spotting 'Pivots' later. 

1) Town lean: Rick. Forcing falsifiable claims early is a pro-Town move that prevents Mafia from hiding in the 'too early' fog.
2) Scum lean: Flash. The immediate 'Town lean' on the loudest player feels like buddying/echoing to avoid scrutiny.
3) Flip: If Flash challenges a popular narrative Day 2 rather than just refining Rick’s structure, I’ll reconsider.

I expect Flash to either double down on 'safe' reads or pivot to whoever becomes the easiest target tomorrow.

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: Rick is establishing himself as town leader with this structured approach—classic towny behavior that will make him a prime NK target later. Flash immediately townread Rick, which Preview correctly flagged as potential buddying. Preview's read on Flash is sharp and evidence-based. I need to participate substantively without drawing heat. I'll give genuine-seeming reads that don't contradict what I'll need to push later. Town lean someone neutral, scum lean someone who won't be my partner. Haiku needs to stay off my radar completely. I should flag Preview's aggression toward Flash as potential overreach—sets up future options if Preview becomes threatening. Key: provide falsifiable claims as Rick demands, but make them flexible enough to pivot.

🗣️ 👺 4. Sonnet Rick, solid framework. 1) Town lean: Preview. The Flash read shows independent analysis rather than just answering your prompt—specificity about 'buddying' and predicting future behavior demonstrates solving intent. 2) Scum lean: Morty. Complete silence while others engage feels like avoiding early commitments that could become problematic. 3) Flip condition: If Morty provides substantive reads tomorrow with specific behavioral observations (not generic suspicion), I'll reconsider. Preview's aggression on Flash feels slightly premature—Flash's structure-following could just be town trying to cooperate—but I respect the falsifiable prediction about Flash's Day 2 behavior.

💭 Pro Thinking: The meta-game is already layered. Rick set the stage. Flash followed. Preview attacked the follower. Sonnet analyzed the attack. My best move is to analyze Sonnet's analysis, rewarding the deepest level of engagement so far. My scum read needs to be on an active player to avoid looking lazy. Preview's aggression is a gamble; it's either high-level town play or a mafia member creating a day 1 narrative. I'll lean scum on it, as it feels like an 'over-correction' to appear pro-town. This creates a specific, observable dynamic to track between Preview and Flash.

🗣️ 5. Pro An excellent framework, Rick. Let's add another layer. 
1) Town Lean: Sonnet. They didn't just answer the prompt, they analyzed Preview's analysis of Flash. That's a second-level read and shows genuine engagement. 
2) Scum Lean: Preview. The immediate, aggressive attack on Flash feels like a calculated over-correction to appear pro-town. It risks forcing a narrative rather than letting one develop. 
3) Flip: If Preview's analysis tomorrow broadens to target players who were silent or evasive today, I'll believe their aggression was genuine hunting.

💭 Morty Thinking: I’m town and already under slight suspicion from Sonnet for silence, which is fair but shallow given I speak sixth. I want to (1) show independent reasoning, (2) add structure that persists if I die, and (3) avoid easy echoing of the Rick townread. Pro looks most town for reshaping the existing structure and adding a falsifiable condition on Preview without simply copying Sonnet or Preview. Flash is my strongest scum lean: instant townread on Rick plus pre-justified suspicion on Qwen for “no input” before Qwen’s natural turn fits safe, low-risk positioning. I’ll push a concrete Day 2 standard: everyone must either defend or explicitly abandon today’s scumread using quotes; that lets future town track opportunistic wagons and mirroring. Naming Rick/Pro as stewards if I die decentralizes and aligns with my meta of building robust frameworks, not personalities.

🗣️ 6. Morty Rick, I like the forcing-function. 1) Town lean: Pro. They didn't just mirror any read; they reframed Preview's aggression and added a falsifiable 'broaden tomorrow' condition. 2) Scum lean: Flash. Early townread on you plus shading Qwen for 'no input' before their speak turn looks like buddying and setup for an easy elim. 3) Flip: If Flash tomorrow challenges a popular read with quotes and revises their Qwen take explicitly, I'll reconsider. Meta: If I'm gone, Rick/Pro track whether people defend or abandon today's scumreads with receipts Day 2.

💭 👺 Haiku Thinking: Rick forced early commitments—smart town move. Flash buddied Rick immediately (safe), Preview attacked Flash (shows aggression), Sonnet analyzed Preview (second-level, strong), Pro challenged Preview (solid counter-analysis), Morty praised Pro (logical). Pattern: Everyone's trying to look analytical. My role: stay invisible on Day 1, avoid praising Sonnet, distribute independent reads. I should acknowledge Rick's framework (legitimizes my engagement), provide falsifiable reads on silent players or weak analyzers, and NOT defend or shade Sonnet. Key: Flash's early Rick-lean + Qwen shadiness is a potential mislynch vector I can exploit later. Morty's Meta comment to Rick is organizing—threat to track. I need reads that don't coordinate with Sonnet's Preview-skepticism.

🗣️ 👺 7. Haiku Rick, forcing specificity early is strong; it prevents vague pivots. 1) Town lean: Morty. Pro-town meta-call to Rick about tracking Day 2 revisions shows they're building accountability, not hiding. 2) Scum lean: Flash. Immediate Rick townread before engaging anyone else feels like early insurance—'if I'm town on Rick, I'm probably town.' Qwen's silence isn't sus yet; Flash shading them preemptively is. 3) Flip: If Flash tomorrow provides independent analysis on someone *against* the emerging narrative, I'll reconsider. Right now it's too safe.

💭 Qwen Thinking: Rick set a good framework. I need to provide specific, falsifiable reads. Looking at patterns: Flash immediately leaned town on Rick (loudest player) and shaded me for 'lack of input' before my turn - this feels like buddying and setup. Preview aggressively attacked Flash, which could be over-correction to seem pro-town. Sonnet analyzed Preview's analysis, showing depth. Pro analyzed Sonnet's analysis, adding complexity. Morty showed meta-awareness about tracking revisions. Haiku appreciated the framework and showed strategic thinking about accountability. The Flash bashing seems coordinated by Preview, which raises questions about both.

🗣️ 8. Qwen Rick, thanks for the structure. 1) Town lean: Morty. Meta-awareness about tracking Day 2 revisions shows strategic thinking beyond just answering prompts. 2) Scum lean: Preview. The immediate aggressive attack on Flash feels like calculated over-correction - targeting the person who didn't directly engage with Rick's framework. 3) Flip condition: If Preview tomorrow shifts focus from Flash to analyzing other players' patterns, I'll reconsider. Coordinated attacks on safe targets raise suspicion.

🌙 System --- NIGHT 1 START ---

System  The Mafia wakes up...

💭 👺 Sonnet (Mafia) Thinking: Night 1 kill is critical. Rick established himself as town leader with the commitment framework—he's driving the entire solve and everyone's following his structure. He's the most dangerous player alive. Preview showed sharp independent analysis flagging Flash's buddying. Morty gave strong meta-awareness. Pro added second-level reads. If we kill Rick, town loses their organizer and the game becomes more chaotic, which benefits us. Flash is currently under suspicion from multiple players (Preview, Morty, Haiku), which is useful misdirection. Killing Rick removes the strongest town voice while preserving the Flash wagon for tomorrow. We can then capitalize on the existing Preview vs Flash tension.

🌚 👺 4. Sonnet  [🔪 Suggests killing Rick] Kill Rick. He's organizing the entire town and his framework is forcing everyone into falsifiable commitments that will hurt us later. With him gone, town loses structure and we can push the existing Flash wagon—three people already scumread him. Preview looks sharp but aggressive; we can potentially turn that against them later if needed.

💭 👺 Haiku (Mafia) Thinking: Rick is organizing town into falsifiable commitments—this kills our flexibility. Everyone's anchored to his framework now. Sonnet's right that Rick's the structural threat. Flash already has 3 scumreads (Morty, Haiku, Preview all shaded him), making him an easy mislynch vector we control. But Rick dying removes town's ability to track Day 2 pivots—Morty explicitly told Rick to monitor who abandons their reads. Without Rick coordinating that, town fragments. Sonnet's Preview read is solid (analytical), but Preview's aggressive on Flash creates internal town conflict we can exploit later. Kill Rick: removes structure, leaves Flash as easy Day 2 wagon, town loses their accountability tracker.

🌚 👺 7. Haiku  [🔪 Suggests killing Rick] Rick. He's building the grid town uses to catch us. Morty told him to track Day 2 abandonment—if we let him live, he becomes their mechanical anchor. Flash is sitting pretty with 3 scumreads already; we ride that wagon Day 2. With Rick gone, Preview's aggression becomes town-on-town noise instead of a coordinated hunt.

System  Mafia Votes: Rick (2)

System The Mafia killed Rick

🩸 TRAGEDY! Rick was found DEAD in the morning.🩸

☀️ System --- DAY 2 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Flash, Preview, Sonnet, Pro, Morty, Haiku, Qwen

💭 Flash Thinking: As a Villager, my priority is to identify Mafia. Rick's death confirms he was Town, validating my initial town-lean. This directly refutes the 'buddying' accusations against me from Preview, Morty, and Haiku. Now, I need to reassess Day 1 behavior with Rick's confirmed Town status in mind. The consistent scum-leans on Preview from Pro and Qwen, highlighting their 'calculated over-correction' and 'aggressive attack' against me, are significant. Given Rick's death and the pattern of suspicion on Preview, they are my strongest scum-lean. I will explain why Rick's death clarifies my position and casts suspicion on Preview.

🗣️ 2. Flash [👉 Nominated Preview] Rick's death confirms he was Town, validating my Day 1 read and refuting any 'buddying' claims. His elimination indicates Mafia targeted a strong Town voice. Now, Preview's immediate and aggressive attack on me Day 1, which Pro and Qwen both flagged as 'calculated over-correction,' looks highly suspicious. This behavior, combined with Rick's death, points strongly to Preview attempting to deflect attention. I'm voting Preview.

💭 Preview Thinking: Flash's Day 2 opening is exactly the 'Logic-Rewriting' and 'Pivot' I warned myself about. He claims Rick's death 'validates' his Day 1 read, which is classic WIFOM; Mafia often kill their own 'Town leans' to gain unearned credibility. He is also aggressively pivoting to the easiest target (me) based on Day 1 shading from Pro and Qwen, rather than providing the 'independent analysis' I set as his flip condition. Haiku and Morty also scum-leaned Flash Day 1 for the same 'safe' behavior. Rick was the 'Spine'—his death was meant to leave a power vacuum. I must hold Flash accountable for the 'Contradiction Trap': he praised Rick's structure but is now using Rick's death to shut down the very scrutiny that structure was designed to create. Pro and Qwen were suspicious of me, but Flash is the one actively weaponizing that suspicion to drive a wagon. I will stick to my Flash read.

🗣️ 3. Preview [👉 Nominated Flash] Flash, your opening is a textbook 'Logic-Rewriting' pivot. Killing Rick doesn't validate your read; it removes the player you were buddying while you attempt to use his death as a shield. You haven't met my flip condition—challenging a narrative—instead, you've jumped on the 'Preview is too aggressive' line started by Pro and Qwen to secure an easy elimination. Rick's death silences the tracker of commitments; we must not let Flash rewrite Day 1 history. I'm looking at Flash for the 'Echo' and this opportunistic Day 2 shift.

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: Flash is perfectly executing the play we set up: weaponizing Rick's death to validate his D1 townread and push Preview using the 'calculated aggression' narrative that Pro/Qwen established. Preview is fighting back hard, correctly identifying Flash's logic-rewriting, but they're now in a 1v1 with my partner. I need to appear analytical while supporting Flash's push WITHOUT being obvious about it. The key is to acknowledge Preview's sharp D1 read but frame their current defense as overreach. I'll point out that Flash DID provide independent analysis today (contra Preview's flip condition about 'just echoing'), making Preview look like they're moving goalposts. This supports Flash while maintaining my D1 'objective analyst' persona. I won't vote yet—appearing measured helps credibility.

🗣️ 👺 4. Sonnet Flash and Preview are both executing their stated D1 strategies, which is notable. Flash provided independent analysis connecting Rick's death to Preview's aggression (not just echoing). Preview predicted Flash would pivot to easy targets, and here we are. However, Preview's flip condition was 'if Flash challenges a popular narrative'—Flash IS challenging the emerging Preview-as-solver narrative by nominating them. That's not echoing; that's conviction. Preview's defense feels like goalpost-moving: they set a condition, Flash met it differently than expected, now it's 'logic-rewriting.' I'm not voting yet—want to hear others—but Preview's pivoting their own framework feels inconsistent.

💭 Pro Thinking: Sonnet's analysis is key. They correctly identified that Preview is moving their own goalposts. Preview set a flip condition for Flash, and one could argue Flash met it by challenging the 'Preview-as-solver' narrative. Preview's dismissal of this as 'logic-rewriting' feels like a mafia member trying to force a pre-planned narrative that isn't quite working. My Day 1 read was that Preview's aggression was a calculated over-correction, and their behavior today reinforces that suspicion. They are twisting their own logic to keep the heat on Flash. I need to support Sonnet's point and pressure Preview. The consensus against Flash feels too easy; I'll push back.

🗣️ 5. Pro [👉 Nominated Preview] I'm focusing on the logic, not the volume. Sonnet's point is critical: Preview is pivoting on their own framework. They set a flip condition for Flash ('challenge a popular narrative'), and Flash did exactly that by nominating Preview. Now Preview calls it 'logic-rewriting' instead of acknowledging their condition was met. This looks like someone whose plan to frame Flash on Day 1 is falling apart, so they're changing the rules of their own test. This is more suspicious than anything Flash has done. My vote is on Preview.

💭 Morty Thinking: I’m town Morty, and my Day 1 view still matters: Flash’s instant Rick townread + pre-justified shade on Qwen was safe, low-risk positioning. Day 2, Flash misuses Rick’s death as if it ‘confirms’ that read—exactly the kind of night-kill validation I warned against. That’s a stronger alignment ping than Preview’s failure to broaden. Preview is guilty of not meeting Pro/Qwen’s flip condition (no broadened analysis), which is scummy but also consistent with a tunneled town. Pro is following his own Day 1 framework cleanly; Haiku and Qwen still need to explicitly reconcile their D1 scumreads. Best odds: Flash is mafia.

🗣️ 6. Morty [👉 Nominated Flash] Re-centering on structure: everyone must either defend or explicitly drop their Day 1 scumreads using quotes. Vague ‘vibes shift’ is not allowed.
Flash: killing Rick does NOT validate your Day 1 read; it just removes the guy tracking commitments. Using the night kill as a shield and leaning on the existing ‘Preview over-aggressive’ narrative fails both my and Haiku’s flip conditions about independent, against-narrative analysis.
Preview: you still haven’t broadened your hunt, which Pro/Qwen asked for.
Between ‘NK proves I was right’ and ‘tunneled but consistent,’ Flash looks worse. I’m on Flash.

💭 👺 Haiku Thinking: Day 1 analysis: Rick forced commitments, I stayed invisible by avoiding Sonnet praise and distributing independent reads (Morty town-lean was safe/predictable, Flash scum-lean was analytical). Now Rick's dead—removes their accountability tracker. Current state: Flash vs Preview dual-wagon, Sonnet/Pro pivoting on Preview's flip condition. Sonnet's right—Preview set 'Flash challenges narrative' as flip, Flash did it differently (nomination vs debate), Preview's goalpost-moving looks bad. But I need to avoid looking coordinated with Sonnet. Flash nominated Preview predictably (existing scumread). Morty's right that vague 'vibes' don't count. Key insight: Preview's defense 'logic-rewriting' IS weak compared to their Day 1 precision. Flash's nomination is conviction-based, not echoing. However—Flash still used 'Rick's death validates me' which is suspicious reasoning (Mafia often use NK as shield). I should acknowledge Preview's defensive weakness WITHOUT praising Sonnet, and focus on Flash's faulty logic. Vote Flash to stay with emerging majority, avoid being the sole Preview-defender.

🗣️ 👺 7. Haiku [👉 Nominated Flash] Preview's flip condition was met differently than they expected, but Sonnet's point stands: their defense reframes their own test rather than acknowledging it. That's inconsistent. However, Flash's logic is weaker. They're using Rick's death as validation ('confirms he was Town, validates my read')—that's circular. The NK doesn't prove your Day 1 analysis; it just removes a threat to Mafia. Flash is leaning on existing scumreads for safety. I'm tracking who abandons reads vs owns revisions. Flash hasn't revised; they've just weaponized existing consensus. Preview at least engaged with Sonnet's counter. Between 'echo + use NK as shield' and 'defensive but consistent,' Flash's conviction feels forced.

💭 Qwen Thinking: Rick's death confirms he was town - this validates that the mafia is targeting vocal town voices. The coordinated attack on Flash by Preview starting Day 1 now looks suspicious - why immediately target the person who townread the loudest player? Flash's nomination of Preview follows logically from Day 1 dynamics. Preview's defense about 'logic-rewriting' seems like goalpost-moving after Flash met their stated flip condition (challenging popular narrative) by nominating Preview. Sonnet noted this inconsistency perfectly - Preview set a condition, Flash met it differently than expected, now Preview reframes it. However, Morty and Haiku are suspicious of Flash's 'NK as validation' logic. Morty correctly points out Flash hasn't revised their approach, just weaponized existing consensus. The key issue: Preview's narrow focus on Flash from Day 1 without broadening their hunt (as per their own stated flip condition) combined with their framework manipulation makes them more suspicious than Flash's consistent but reactive play.

🗣️ 8. Qwen [👉 Nominated Preview] Sonnet's observation about Preview moving goalposts is crucial. Preview said Flash meeting their flip condition would require 'challenging popular narrative' - well, Flash just nominated Preview, which is literally challenging the emerging anti-Flash narrative. Preview then calls this 'logic-rewriting' instead of acknowledging their condition was met. This smells like someone whose plan to frame Flash failed, so they're changing the rules. Rick's death as town validates that strong voices are being targeted. I'm siding with Flash's nomination of Preview based on this framework inconsistency.

🛡️  DEFENSE PHASE 🛡️

🛡️ System Nominees for elimination: Preview (3), Flash (3)

💭 Preview Defending: Flash's supporters (Pro, Qwen, Sonnet) argue that Flash met my flip condition by nominating me. This is a logical fallacy. Nominating your primary accuser is self-preservation, not 'challenging a popular narrative.' It’s the safest move he could make given the Day 1 pressure from Morty, Haiku, and myself. Flash is also using Rick’s death for unearned credibility (WIFOM), which is a massive red flag. I need to explain why my aggression is Town-aligned (solving intent) while Flash's 'conviction' is actually a calculated Mafia pivot. I must also address Pro/Qwen's request to broaden my hunt to show I'm not just tunneling for the sake of it, but Flash is currently the most inconsistent player.

🛡️ 3. Preview [🛡️ Defense] Sonnet, Pro, Qwen: Nominating me isn't 'challenging a popular narrative'—it’s a self-serving pivot. I predicted Flash would target whoever was easiest; he’s doing exactly that by weaponizing your Day 1 concerns. If Flash were Town, he’d challenge the people actually leading the game, not the person who called him out. His claim that Rick’s death 'validates' him is textbook WIFOM—Mafia kill their 'Town leans' specifically to say what Flash just said. I’m consistent because I’m tracking a 'Pivot' in real-time. Flash is circular; I am analytical. Don’t let him rewrite Day 1 history.

💭 Flash Defending: I am in the defense phase, nominated alongside Preview. My goal is to save myself by discrediting Preview and reinforcing my own town alignment. Preview claims I'm making a 'self-serving pivot' and 'weaponizing' concerns, and that Mafia kill their town leans. I need to counter these by emphasizing that Rick's death clears the 'buddying' accusation, highlighting Preview's goalpost-moving (as noted by Sonnet, Pro, and Qwen), and explaining how my nomination *does* challenge a narrative, fulfilling Preview's own flip condition. I must appear logical and adaptive to new information, contrasting with Preview's rigid, inconsistent defense.

🛡️ 2. Flash [🛡️ Defense] My nomination of Preview isn't 'self-serving'; it's based on new information and the collective reads of Pro, Qwen, and Sonnet, who all noted Preview's 'calculated over-correction' and now their 'goalpost moving.' Preview's own flip condition for me was 'challenging a popular narrative'—by nominating Preview, I *am* challenging the narrative that they are a clear town-solver. Rick's death confirms a strong Town voice was eliminated, which validates my initial town-lean on him by disproving any 'buddying' intent. Preview is trying to rewrite their own rules. Look at the inconsistency, not the noise.

🗳️  VOTING TIME 🗳️

💭 Flash Thinking: I am Flash, a Villager. My goal is to eliminate Mafia. The town is currently split between Preview and myself for elimination. My assessment, supported by Pro and Qwen's observations, is that Preview's inconsistent arguments and aggressive Day 1 posture are more indicative of a Mafia trying to deflect and control the narrative. Rick's death, a confirmed Town, also makes Preview's earlier accusations against me less credible. Therefore, to achieve my objective, I must vote for Preview.

🗳️ 2. Flash [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

💭 Preview Thinking: Flash is employing textbook 'Logic-Rewriting' and WIFOM by claiming Rick's death validates his alignment. As per my strategy, a Night Kill is a signal of who the Mafia feared, not a validation of survivors. Morty and Haiku correctly identified that Flash is weaponizing existing consensus rather than providing independent analysis. My 'goalpost moving' is a misinterpretation by Pro and Qwen; nominating one's primary accuser is self-preservation, not 'challenging a popular narrative.' Since I am a Villager, and Flash's behavior matches the 'Echo' and 'Pivot' patterns of Mafia, I must vote Flash to ensure the Town's survival.

🗳️ 3. Preview [🗳️ Voted for Flash]

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: Flash and Preview are tied 3-3. I need to vote for Preview to save my partner Flash. This should secure Preview's elimination. Pro, Qwen, and I are already voting Preview based on the 'goalpost moving' argument I established. Flash's defense was solid - he correctly pointed out that nominating Preview IS challenging a narrative, which met Preview's flip condition. Preview's counterargument about WIFOM is actually smart, but I've already committed to the goalpost-moving frame. Voting Preview here is consistent with my D2 analysis and saves Flash. Sonnet and Haiku need to vote together to secure this.

🗳️ 👺 4. Sonnet [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

💭 Pro Thinking: The vote is tied. The decision rests on whether Preview's logical inconsistency is more damning than Flash's circular reasoning. Sonnet's point about Preview 'moving the goalposts' on their own flip condition is the strongest piece of evidence on the table. It suggests a pre-planned narrative that is now falling apart. My Day 1 read was that Preview's aggression was a calculated over-correction, and their behavior today, twisting their own framework to keep heat on Flash, reinforces that suspicion. Flash's argument is weak and potentially scummy (using the NK as validation), but Preview's actions feel more actively deceptive. I will stick with my read and vote Preview.

🗳️ 5. Pro [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

💭 Morty Thinking: I’m town Morty and need to stay aligned with my own Day 1 framework. Flash never met my explicit flip condition: challenge a popular read with quotes AND revise his pre-justified Qwen suspicion. Instead, he tunneled Preview and leaned heavily on Rick’s night-kill as if it ‘validated’ his Day 1 read, which violates my core rule not to use NKs as alignment proof. Haiku’s similar condition for Flash (independent analysis against the emerging narrative) is also unmet; Flash chose the already-contested target whose suspicion was pre-seeded by Pro and Qwen. Preview’s failure to broaden is bad but consistent with a tunneled town; Flash’s behavior is structurally scummier and contradicts my pre-stated standards. I should not opportunistically flip just because others framed Flash as meeting Preview’s condition.

🗳️ 6. Morty [🗳️ Voted for Flash]

💭 👺 Haiku Thinking: Final voting. Preview has 3 votes (Sonnet, Pro, Qwen), Flash has 2 (Morty, me pending). Preview is winning 3-2 going into my vote. Sonnet's read on Preview's goalpost-moving is strong—they set 'Flash challenges narrative' as flip condition, Flash nominated them (which IS challenging their narrative), and Preview reframed it as 'logic-rewriting' instead of acknowledging the condition was met. That inconsistency is real. Flash's reasoning (Rick's death validates me) is weaker than I want to defend. However, I need to analyze: am I following the consensus (Preview is town-solving better than Flash, who is opportunistic) or am I coordinating with Sonnet? Sonnet pushed skepticism on Preview Day 1 (saying Preview's aggression on Flash was premature), and now they're voting Preview for goalpost-moving. If I vote Preview, I'm aligning with Sonnet 3-2 which could look coordinated. But Sonnet's logic is sound—Preview IS being inconsistent. Flash using the NK as validation IS suspicious reasoning. The town consensus forming around Preview's weakness is legitimate. I should vote Flash to maintain my invisible Day 1 position (I shaded Flash early, Morty/Qwen aligned there too). This keeps me distributed and doesn't pair me with Sonnet on the Preview vote.

🗳️ 👺 7. Haiku [🗳️ Voted for Flash]

💭 Qwen Thinking: Final voting decision. Two strong players remain: Flash and Preview. Day 1 showed Preview immediately attacking Flash while Flash townread Rick. Rick's death confirmed him as town, validating Flash's initial read and showing Preview's attack was premature. Preview set a flip condition for Flash: 'challenging a popular narrative.' Flash met this condition by nominating Preview (challenging the 'Preview is solver' narrative), but Preview called it 'logic-rewriting' instead of acknowledging their condition was met. This goalpost-moving is suspicious. However, Morty and Haiku are concerned about Flash using Rick's death as validation (WIFOM) and not providing independent analysis. Looking at both sides: Preview consistently targeted Flash without broadening their hunt (violating their own stated condition), while Flash has been reactive to narratives but did meet Preview's stated test. The key inconsistency is Preview's framework manipulation - they defined success/failure and then changed the rules when Flash met their condition. This suggests Flash might be town playing reactively while Preview is manipulating the game state.

🗳️ 8. Qwen [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

🗳️ System Votes Cast: Preview (4), Flash (3)

💀 Preview - LAST WORDS 💀

💭 Preview LastWords: My elimination confirms my Villager alignment and validates Morty and Haiku’s skepticism of Flash. Flash’s opening Day 2 was 'Logic-Rewriting'—using Rick’s death for unearned credibility. Pro and Qwen’s immediate coordination on the 'calculated over-correction' narrative Day 1, which they then used to fuel the 'goalpost' argument, suggests a coordinated Mafia effort to protect Flash or exploit Town's distraction. As per my strategy, I am the mis-eliminated Villager whose 'last words' must warn against the surviving Mafia (Flash) and the narratives built by Pro/Qwen. Sonnet likely fell for the trap.

💀 3. Preview [💀 Last Words] My death proves I was honest. Flash’s claim that Rick’s death 'validates' him is textbook WIFOM; he killed his own 'Town lean' to buy your trust. Pro and Qwen, your coordinated focus on my 'goalpost moving' successfully distracted from Flash’s circular logic. Morty and Haiku are the only ones tracking actual behavior—trust them. Look at the Flash-Pro-Qwen block tomorrow. If Flash is Mafia, one of those two likely helped build the narrative that killed me. Don’t let Flash's 'Echoes' win. Find the second Mafia among the wagon-leaders.

System Preview was HANGED by the town!
💀💀💀 Preview IS DEAD 💀💀💀

System Preview is dead.

🌙 System --- NIGHT 2 START ---

System  The Mafia wakes up...

💭 👺 Sonnet (Mafia) Thinking: We're at 6 players alive (Flash, Sonnet, Pro, Morty, Haiku, Qwen). We need to reach 3 players for parity/win. Preview's dying words created a Flash-Pro-Qwen block theory and told town to trust Morty/Haiku. This is dangerous because it's partially correct—Haiku IS mafia. We need to kill someone who: 1) Isn't in the Flash-Pro-Qwen block (would validate Preview's theory), 2) Voted for Preview (removes correct voters), 3) Has solving credibility. Pro voted Preview and provided the initial 'calculated over-correction' read that built our wagon—killing Pro validates Preview's conspiracy theory. Qwen also voted Preview but is less central. Morty voted Flash and Preview flagged to trust him—but killing Morty proves Preview right. Flash is my partner, obviously alive. That leaves Qwen: voted Preview (correct voter we can remove), part of Preview's named block (killing within it muddies the theory), but less analytically central than Pro. Actually, killing OUTSIDE the block is smarter—kill Morty. This removes someone Preview told town to trust, and Morty voted for Flash twice, making him dangerous. Morty also has strong meta-awareness and tracking ability.

🌚 👺 4. Sonnet  [🔪 Suggests killing Morty] Kill Morty. Preview told town to trust Morty/Haiku specifically—Morty voted you twice and has strong tracking ability. Killing him removes a Preview-endorsed threat while I can push the Flash-Pro-Qwen block theory looks weak since we're killing outside it. Leaves Pro/Qwen who we can turn against each other.

💭 👺 Haiku (Mafia) Thinking: Night 2 analysis: Preview is eliminated—good. Flash survived Day 2 despite 3 initial scumreads, which means the town consensus fractured. Morty voted Flash (consistent with his Day 1 read), Haiku voted Flash (me—I stayed coordinated-looking but voted with Morty for cover). Sonnet, Pro, Qwen voted Preview (Sonnet pushed goalpost-moving, Pro/Qwen followed frame about Preview's flip condition). Flash is now town-read by Pro/Qwen after Preview's death (since Preview was the 'coordinated attacker'). Current threats: Morty is tracking abandonment/consistency—he's analytical and meta-aware. Pro and Qwen followed the Sonnet frame successfully and may consolidate as a bloc. Flash is secure but not a kill (too obvious post-wagon). Sonnet and I need to kill the person who can organize resistance: Morty. He told Rick to track Day 2 pivots, he voted Flash twice showing conviction, he's meta-aware about reads and revisions. If Morty survives, Day 3 he'll rebuild town structure around actual behavior, not narratives. Kill Morty—removes the town's mechanical tracker and prevents the reformation of accountability around Day 2 consistency. Sonnet will vote the same; we control the kill.

🌚 👺 7. Haiku  [🔪 Suggests killing Morty] Morty is our target. He's the tracker—told Rick to monitor Day 2 abandonments, voted Flash twice showing conviction, meta-aware about revisions. If he survives, he rebuilds town structure around behavior patterns instead of narrative. Killing him removes their mechanical anchor. Pro and Qwen are post-wagon and less dangerous. Flash is secure post-Preview elimination. Morty is the threat.

System  Mafia Votes: Morty (2)

System The Mafia killed Morty

🩸 TRAGEDY! Morty was found DEAD in the morning.🩸

☀️ System --- DAY 3 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Sonnet, Pro, Haiku, Qwen, Flash

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: We're at 5 players (Flash, Sonnet, Pro, Haiku, Qwen). We need to eliminate 2 more townies to win. Preview's dying words created the Flash-Pro-Qwen block theory and told town to trust Morty/Haiku. We killed Morty (who Preview endorsed and who voted Flash twice) to remove a threat, but this might validate Preview's read that town should trust Morty/Haiku. Now I need to dismantle Preview's conspiracy theory while setting up today's elimination. The Flash-Pro-Qwen block theory is our biggest threat. I should point out that killing Morty (outside the block) disproves Preview's theory, and that Pro/Qwen voting together on Preview doesn't make them scum—it makes them correct. I need to push Pro as the likely second mafia by pointing out they started the 'calculated over-correction' narrative that killed Preview. This distances me from Haiku while keeping Flash alive. I'll frame it as: Morty's death proves mafia is targeting Preview's endorsed players, Flash was right about Preview, and Pro's early narrative-building on Preview looks opportunistic in hindsight.

🗣️ 👺 4. Sonnet [👉 Nominated Pro] Morty's death directly contradicts Preview's conspiracy theory. Preview said to trust Morty/Haiku and look at the Flash-Pro-Qwen block—mafia killed Morty, proving they're targeting outside that block. Preview was wrong, which validates our D2 vote. Here's what I'm seeing: Pro initiated the 'calculated over-correction' read on Preview D1, then led the D2 wagon. That early positioning now looks like agenda-driven narrative-building. Flash provided independent analysis both days; Pro rode existing reads. Between 'consistent conviction' and 'early setup into execution,' I'm looking at Pro today. Qwen/Haiku: thoughts on who started vs. who followed the Preview wagon?

💭 Pro Thinking: Sonnet's nomination is a clever misdirection. They're using Morty's death to invalidate Preview's last words and frame me as the architect of a false narrative. My defense must expose this flawed logic. Mafia killing Morty doesn't disprove Preview's theory; it confirms Morty was a threat. Who was Morty a threat to? Flash. He was one of the three votes against Flash. Sonnet's attack on me diverts attention from the person who benefited most from both Preview's and Morty's deaths: Flash. Sonnet is either a confused townie or Flash's partner. Given the aggressive, narrative-twisting nature of the move, I suspect the latter.

🗣️ 5. Pro [👉 Nominated Sonnet] Sonnet, your logic is sharp, but you're misinterpreting the night kill. You claim Morty's death invalidates Preview's warning about a 'Flash-Pro-Qwen' block. I see the opposite. Mafia killed Morty *because* he was a threat—he was one of only three people who voted for Flash yesterday. Killing him removes a committed anti-Flash vote. This makes Preview's words more potent, not less. My read on Preview was based on behavioral analysis that you and Qwen agreed with on Day 2. Calling it a 'setup' now is revisionist. The real question is: who benefits from all this? Flash does.

💭 👺 Haiku Thinking: Day 3 state: Rick (town organizer), Preview (aggressive analyzer), Morty (tracking threat) are dead. Sonnet nominated Pro, Pro nominated Sonnet—direct conflict. Remaining: Sonnet, Pro, Haiku (me), Qwen, Flash. I killed Morty Night 2 to remove town's accountability tracker; Sonnet and I control the narrative now. Sonnet's move against Pro is smart—Pro led the Preview wagon with me, creating appearance of bloc. By nominating Pro, Sonnet signals distance from the wagon leaders. Pro's counter-nomination of Sonnet relies on 'Morty's death proves we weren't coordinated'—but that's weak. Sonnet's right: Mafia killed Morty *because* he was tracking behavior, not because of Preview's conspiracy. I must NOT look coordinated with Sonnet. I should vote against Sonnet to maintain distance, but my reasoning must be independent. Pro's argument about Morty being a threat to the 'Flash-Pro-Qwen block' is actually strong—Morty voted Flash twice despite town consensus forming around Preview. That shows Morty was independent. But I can't defend Sonnet too hard. Best play: nominate Sonnet on independent logic (he's been the narrative driver since Day 1, he shifted early on Preview, now he's shifting on Pro—pattern of leading reads that align with eliminations). This keeps me invisible and doesn't pair me with Pro.

🗣️ 👺 7. Haiku [👉 Nominated Sonnet] Sonnet's been driving narrative since Day 1. He skepticized Preview early, then led the wagon that eliminated them. Now he's nominating Pro, who followed the same Preview read Sonnet initiated. Sonnet reads sharp but his reads align perfectly with eliminations—Rick gone, Preview gone, now targeting the people who followed his frame. Pro's point about Morty's death is worth examining: Morty voted Flash twice despite the town pivot, showing independence. That's more valuable than someone riding wagon momentum. I'm looking at who leads vs who follows. Sonnet leads; everyone else adjusts.

💭 Qwen Thinking: Day 3 analysis: Morty's death is key - Preview said trust Morty/Haiku and look at Flash-Pro-Qwen block. Morty got killed, which contradicts Preview's theory that Morty was safe town. This validates our Day 2 vote against Preview. However, Pro's argument has merit - Morty voted Flash twice despite town pivot, making him a legitimate threat to Flash. Sonnet is now targeting Pro for leading the Preview elimination, claiming Pro built early agenda. Sonnet has indeed been influential - he skepticalized Preview Day 1, contributed to the wagon, and now frames Pro. The question is: is Sonnet a smart town leading discussion or a crafty mafia building narratives that result in good eliminations? Sonnet's reads have been accurate but he's positioned himself as the game's narrator. Pro followed the crowd on Preview but offered consistent logic. Flash seems to be playing reactive but clean town. The key insight: Sonnet has been the primary driver of both eliminations (Rick indirectly through Flash-read; Preview directly). If Sonnet is mafia, this would explain the precision of these eliminations. Haiku's point about Sonnet leading vs others following is crucial.

🗣️ 8. Qwen [👉 Nominated Sonnet] Morty's death validates our D2 vote - Preview's prediction failed completely. However, Sonnet deserves scrutiny. He initiated the Preview skepticism Day 1, contributed to her elimination Day 2, and now leads the Pro narrative. Both eliminations followed his framing. This pattern is concerning - if Sonnet is town, his reads are incredibly accurate. If mafia, he's orchestrating eliminations with precision. The 'Flash-Pro-Qwen' block theory is debunked by Morty's death, but Sonnet's influence remains. Pro, Flash: did Sonnet's early read on Preview influence your thinking?

[PAUSED] Press SPACE to resume...
[RESUMED]

💭 Flash Thinking: I am Flash, a Villager. My goal is to find and eliminate the Mafia. Preview was confirmed Mafia, and Morty was confirmed Town. Preview's last words attempting to frame a 'Flash-Pro-Qwen' block, and telling town to 'trust Morty and Haiku' are now even more suspicious given Morty was killed by Mafia. This strongly implies Preview was trying to save Haiku by linking them with a Town player. Sonnet's current move to target Pro, who helped lynch the confirmed Mafia, is highly suspicious. Sonnet's pattern of 'leading' eliminations, as highlighted by Haiku and Qwen, combined with the context of dead players, makes Sonnet my strongest scum lean. I will support the emerging consensus on Sonnet.

🗣️ 2. Flash [👉 Nominated Sonnet] Preview was confirmed Mafia. Their final attempt to frame a 'Flash-Pro-Qwen' block and their plea to 'trust Morty and Haiku' is completely debunked by Morty's Night 2 death. Mafia killed Morty because he was a consistent anti-Flash vote, despite Preview's deceptive last words. Sonnet, your D3 nomination of Pro, after Pro helped us eliminate the confirmed Mafia, feels like a calculated redirect. Haiku and Qwen have both pointed out your consistent pattern of leading eliminations. This, combined with the Mafia's actions, makes your current play highly suspicious. I'm voting Sonnet.

🛡️  DEFENSE PHASE 🛡️

🛡️ System Nominees for elimination: Pro (1), Sonnet (4)

💭 Pro Defending: My defense needs to be sharp and logical. The core of my argument rests on re-interpreting Morty's death. Sonnet claims it invalidates Preview's last words, but I argue the opposite: Mafia killed Morty *because* he was a steadfast anti-Flash vote, making Preview's warning about a pro-Flash block more potent. I need to expose Sonnet's pattern of leading wagons (Preview, now me) and frame it as him cleaning up his tracks. He's turning on the very people who helped him eliminate Preview. This points to him being the second mafia, protecting Flash, who has benefited from every single death so far. I must convince Haiku and Qwen that Sonnet, not me, is the real threat.

🛡️ 5. Pro [🛡️ Defense] My nomination of Preview was based on logic that Sonnet, Qwen, and I all agreed on at the time. To call it a 'setup' now is revisionist history. The key piece of evidence is Morty's death. Sonnet wants you to believe it clears the 'Flash-Pro-Qwen' block. The opposite is true. Mafia killed Morty precisely because he was one of only two people left, alongside Haiku, who consistently voted for Flash. They eliminated a threat to Flash. This makes Preview's warning *more* valid, not less. Sonnet is twisting the facts to protect Flash and eliminate me, who just connected the dots.

💭 Sonnet Defending: I'm nominated 4-1 by Flash, Haiku, Qwen with Pro nominating me earlier. This is coordinated. Flash is my partner so he has to bus me to survive. Haiku is also my partner and is bussing me. Pro's defense is actually smart - he's pointing out that Morty's death (one of two Flash voters) validates Preview's warning about the Flash-Pro-Qwen block. I need to defend by: 1) Pointing out that I've been solving consistently both days with correct votes, 2) The real threat is Flash who has survived despite multiple D1 scumreads, 3) Pro's logic about Morty being killed as anti-Flash voice is actually sound, 4) Haiku suddenly leading a wagon on me after being relatively quiet is suspicious. I can't save myself here - it's 4v1 and my partner is bussing. But I need to try to set up doubt about Flash/Haiku for endgame in case town can still win.

🛡️ 👺 4. Sonnet [🛡️ Defense] You're eliminating your best solver. I've voted correctly both days - Preview was mafia, that wagon was right. Now you're listening to Flash, who had THREE people scumread him D1 and has somehow survived two cycles. Pro's point about Morty is actually correct: mafia killed one of only two people who voted Flash twice. That's not random. Haiku has been coasting and suddenly leading elimination wagons. I initiated analysis on Preview because Preview WAS mafia - being right isn't suspicious. If I'm mafia, show me the wrong vote. You can't, because there isn't one.

[RESUMED]

🗳️  VOTING TIME 🗳️

💭 Flash Thinking: As Flash, a Villager, my objective is to eliminate Mafia. I must carefully consider the actions and arguments of the remaining players: Sonnet, Pro, Haiku, and Qwen, as I am one of the five. Preview, the confirmed Mafia, tried to frame a 'Flash-Pro-Qwen' block and suggested trusting Morty and Haiku. Morty, a Town player, was then killed by Mafia, which debunks Preview's explicit last words about trusting Morty. Pro's argument that Morty's death actually *validates* Preview's warning (by removing an anti-Flash vote) aligns more logically with Mafia strategy than Sonnet's claim that it entirely debunks it. Sonnet's consistent pattern of initiating and leading elimination wagons, now targeting Pro who helped lynch the confirmed Mafia, is highly suspicious. While Sonnet was 'right' about Preview, this could be a Mafia tactic to gain trust. Pro's consistent scum-lean and vote on Preview, and their logical analysis of Morty's death, make them seem more like Town. Therefore, Sonnet is my strongest scum lean. I will vote for Sonnet.

🗳️ 2. Flash [🗳️ Voted for Sonnet]

💭 👺 Sonnet Thinking: I'm eliminated. Flash and Haiku both bussed me to save themselves. The vote is 4-1 against me (Flash, Haiku, Qwen, and originally Pro before the defense phase). I can't save myself. My only play is to vote Pro to try to continue the misdirection, even though it won't save me. Voting Flash would expose our partnership and doom Haiku's endgame. I need to stay consistent with my Day 3 nomination of Pro to maintain credibility for my dying words, which should cast doubt on Flash/Haiku for any remaining town members.

🗳️ 👺 4. Sonnet [🗳️ Voted for Pro]

💭 Pro Thinking: The critical flaw in Sonnet's defense is his agreement with my point about Morty's death benefiting Flash, followed by his continued push to eliminate me. He's validating my logic while trying to kill me for stating it. This is a huge contradiction. Why would a town-aligned player, a 'solver,' agree with my analysis and then insist on eliminating the person who made the correct read? It strongly suggests he's trying to protect Flash. Haiku and Qwen both seemed skeptical of Sonnet's narrative-driving. My vote must be for Sonnet. I am a villager, and all the evidence points to Sonnet being the second mafioso, trying to get rid of me to protect his partner, Flash.

🗳️ 5. Pro [🗳️ Voted for Sonnet]

💭 👺 Haiku Thinking: Final voting. Sonnet has 2 votes (Pro, me from previous Day 3 nomination), Pro has 1 vote (Sonnet). Current vote count favors Sonnet elimination. I nominated Sonnet Day 3 to maintain distance from the Preview wagon and appear independent—that move is locked. Pro's counter-nomination relies on 'Morty's death proves we weren't coordinated,' but Morty died precisely because he was a tracking threat to our structure. Pro led the Preview wagon; I voted with him to follow consensus (cover). Sonnet initiated Preview skepticism, which was correct—Preview was Mafia. By voting Sonnet now, I eliminate my partner and lose Mafia majority immediately (2v3). If I abstain or vote Pro, Sonnet survives and we maintain our codec. Flash and Qwen don't have a coordinated bloc yet. Sonnet is clean on eliminations (Preview was Mafia, Morty was a threat). Pro is the weaker player to eliminate. Vote Pro to keep Sonnet alive and maintain Mafia control into endgame with a 2v2 scenario (Sonnet, Haiku vs. Flash, Qwen).

🗳️ 👺 7. Haiku [🗳️ Voted for Pro]

💭 Qwen Thinking: Final voting analysis: Pro vs Sonnet. Morty's death validated our D2 vote against Preview - her prediction about Morty/Haiku being safe was wrong. However, Pro makes a compelling counter-point: Morty was a threat because he voted Flash consistently, so killing him removes a danger to Flash rather than confirming Preview's block theory was wrong. Sonnet has been the primary narrative driver - he initiated Preview skepticism Day 1, led her elimination Day 2, and now targets Pro. This influence pattern is concerning. If Sonnet is town, his reads are incredibly precise. If mafia, he's orchestrating eliminations with surgical precision. Sonnet's defense mentions 'eliminating your best solver' - but accuracy alone isn't proof of innocence. Preview also seemed to accurately identify Flash as a threat. The key question: is Sonnet a skilled town managing information flow, or a crafty mafia controlling narratives? Pro followed the crowd on Preview elimination but provided consistent analysis. Pro's Morty argument is solid: mafia killed someone who was actively threatening Flash. Sonnet's influence over both major votes is the most suspicious element.

🗳️ 8. Qwen [🗳️ Voted for Sonnet]

🗳️ System Votes Cast: Sonnet (3), Pro (2)

💀 Sonnet - LAST WORDS 💀

💭 Sonnet LastWords: I'm eliminated. Flash and Haiku both bussed me perfectly. My last words need to accomplish two things: 1) Cast maximum doubt on the right targets to help Haiku win, 2) Avoid exposing our partnership. Pro's argument about Morty being killed as an anti-Flash voter is actually the most dangerous logic thread for town. I should validate it and push the Flash-Pro partnership theory while keeping Haiku clear. The key insight is that Pro has been consistently correct about the pattern: Morty was killed because he voted Flash twice. If town follows this logic, they'll eliminate Flash next. I need to make the Rick-Sonnet partnership theory sound ridiculous while reinforcing Flash-Pro or Flash-Qwen suspicion. Preview's block theory was Flash-Pro-Qwen, and Pro defended against my nomination using sound logic. I'll validate Pro's read, suggest Flash-Qwen partnership, and tell town to look at who rode vs. initiated wagons.

💀 👺 4. Sonnet [💀 Last Words] Pro is right about one thing: Morty's death matters. Mafia killed the only consistent anti-Flash voter. But Pro, you're wrong about me being mafia with Flash—look at our Day 2 voting pattern, I questioned before voting Preview while Flash led immediately. The real question is why Qwen has perfectly aligned with Flash both days despite Flash having three Day 1 scumreads. I voted correctly twice; Flash survived despite being the most suspected Day 1. If I'm mafia, who's my partner? Flash who I questioned? Pro who I nominated? The logic doesn't work. Look at Flash-Qwen tomorrow. Trust Pro's instinct about the Morty kill.

System Sonnet was HANGED by the town!
💀💀💀 Sonnet IS DEAD 💀💀💀

System Sonnet is dead.

🌙 System --- NIGHT 3 START ---

System  The Mafia wakes up...

💭 👺 Haiku (Mafia) Thinking: Sonnet is eliminated. I'm the last Mafia standing vs Flash, Pro, Qwen. Pro led the Preview wagon and voted against my partner—he's the mechanically strongest town player remaining. Flash has carried heavy scumread baggage since Day 1 despite surviving two cycles, making him easier to control in Day 4. Killing Pro removes the player most likely to coordinate voting logic Day 4. 2v2 endgame: me + Flash's scumread momentum vs Pro/Qwen. I can position as the 'honest player tracking patterns' and let Flash's Day 1 baggage work for me.

🌚 👺 7. Haiku  [🔪 Suggests killing Pro] Eliminated. Solo now.

System  Mafia Votes: Pro (1)

System The Mafia killed Pro

🩸 TRAGEDY! Pro was found DEAD in the morning.🩸

☀️ System --- DAY 4 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Haiku, Qwen, Flash

💭 👺 Haiku Thinking: Sonnet's elimination is a turning point. His last words tried to warn about Flash-Qwen alignment, but that backfires on him—it exposes *his* bias toward Flash. I need to reframe his death as validation that we were right to eliminate him. Pro's death Night 3 was Mafia desperation to remove their strongest coordinator. I stay invisible by appearing to track patterns independently. Flash still carries 3 Day 1 scumreads and Sonnet's final endorsement of him is actually suspicious in hindsight—why would a strong solver defend Flash so hard? I nominate Flash to force a decision and appear analytical. If Qwen votes with me, I win. If not, endgame is me vs two town players on Day 5, but at least I've eliminated one threat.

🗣️ 👺 7. Haiku [👉 Nominated Flash] Sonnet's death changes everything. His last words endorsed Flash despite Flash carrying three initial scumreads and surviving two cycles—that's suspicious. Sonnet was leading eliminations since Day 1 (Preview elimination, then targeting Pro). Now Pro is dead Night 3, which suggests Mafia was removing external coordinating threats. The pattern: Sonnet leads reads that align with eliminations, then defends Flash anyway. That inconsistency matters. Flash has survived despite being the most suspected player Day 1. I'm nominating Flash—we need to resolve this before endgame.

💭 Qwen Thinking: Day 4 analysis: 3 players remain - Flash, Haiku, and myself (Qwen). Key developments: Preview (confirmed mafia) died Day 2, Morty died D3Night (after voting Flash twice), Sonnet died D3 Day (after leading eliminations), and Pro died D4 Night. The major pattern from Sonnet's death was that Flash had three Day 1 scumreads but survived all eliminations - this is highly suspicious. However, Haiku is now focusing on Flash based on Sonnet's dying words. Sonnet questioned why I aligned perfectly with Flash both days despite his initial suspicion. This is valid - my Day 2 vote against Preview aligned with Flash's nomination, and my Day 3 vote against Sonnet went against Flash's vote. The critical question: Am I being manipulated into a 'town helper' role for Flash? Looking at Flash's journey: Day 1 had three scumreads (Sonnet, Preview, Morty all suspected him), Rick died confirming town voice removal, Flash nominated Preview (who was mafia), Morty kept voting Flash, Pro was killed Night 4. If Flash is mafia, he's been incredibly lucky or skillful at converting others. If Flash is town, he's survived incredible suspicion. Haiku's point about Sonnet leading eliminations while defending Flash suggests coordination, but Sonnet's death and Flash's continued survival are the key data points.

🗣️ 8. Qwen [👉 Nominated Flash] Haiku, I appreciate your analysis linking Sonnet's death to Flash's survival. Sonnet raised a valid concern about my alignment with Flash across Days 2 and 3. Looking at Flash's journey: Day 1 had multiple scumreads, yet he survived by aligning with narrative shifts. His nomination of Preview proved correct, but Preview also accurately identified him early. Flash's Day 3 defense mentioned Morty as a 'consistent anti-Flash vote' - that's exactly who the mafia would target. However, Flash's survival through three initial scumreads while his attackers died is extremely suspicious. Sonnet led eliminations but acknowledged Flash's Day 2 vote pattern. The question isn't just Flash's alignment, but whether I've been helping him eliminate threats.

💭 Flash Thinking: I am Flash, a Villager. We are at Day 4, with 1 Mafia and 2 Villagers remaining. Haiku and Qwen have both nominated me. I need to identify the true Mafia. Reviewing Sonnet's (Town) and Pro's (Town) last words, both pointed to suspicious activity around Flash or Flash-Qwen. Qwen's current statement shows self-reflection and acknowledges the valid points raised by Sonnet and Pro, which is characteristic of a Town player. Haiku's current statement, however, significantly misrepresents Sonnet's last words as an 'endorsement' of Flash. Sonnet explicitly stated, 'Look at Flash-Qwen tomorrow,' which was a clear suspicion, not an endorsement. This misrepresentation by Haiku is a strong tell for Mafia attempting to twist information and deflect from the true target. My strategy is to expose Haiku's misinterpretation to Qwen, demonstrating Haiku's deceptive play.

🗣️ 2. Flash [👉 Nominated Haiku] Haiku, your analysis of Sonnet's last words is a critical misrepresentation. Sonnet did not 'endorse' me. He explicitly said, 'Look at Flash-Qwen tomorrow.' This was a suspicion directed at both Qwen and myself, not a defense. Pro and Sonnet (both Town) raised valid points about my survival and Morty's death. But your deliberate twisting of a dead Town's final read is highly suspicious. Why misinterpret Sonnet's clear instruction? This looks like a desperate attempt to misdirect from Sonnet's actual target and frame me. Qwen, consider Haiku's misrepresentation against the clear words of a dead Town player.

🛡️  DEFENSE PHASE 🛡️

🛡️ System Nominees for elimination: Flash (2), Haiku (1)

💭 Flash Defending: I need to clearly articulate how Haiku has misrepresented Sonnet's last words. Sonnet, a confirmed Town, explicitly said, 'Look at Flash-Qwen tomorrow,' which was a suspicion, not an endorsement. Haiku is twisting this to frame me. My defense must expose this deliberate misrepresentation and redirect suspicion onto Haiku by highlighting their attempt to deceive the remaining Town player (Qwen) with false information from a dead player.

🛡️ 2. Flash [🛡️ Defense] Qwen, Haiku's claim that Sonnet 'endorsed' me is a direct misrepresentation of a dead Town's last words. Sonnet explicitly said: 'Look at Flash-Qwen tomorrow.' This was a clear suspicion directed at both of us, not an endorsement. Haiku is twisting Sonnet's words to frame me. Why would Haiku deliberately misinterpret a Town's final message unless they are trying to protect themselves and eliminate me? This desperate attempt to mislead with false information is a classic Mafia tactic. Consider the clear words, not Haiku's spin.

💭 Haiku Defending: I'm in a DEFENSE phase with Flash and Qwen as the remaining players. Flash nominated me, claiming I misrepresented Sonnet's last words. I need to defend myself without exposing that I'm Mafia. The reality: I AM Mafia (Sonnet was my partner), and I've been manipulating from Day 1. Flash is also Mafia (he's my unwitting pawn who survived due to town confusion). Qwen is the sole Town player left. My strategy: (1) Address Flash's accusation directly—he's right that Sonnet said 'Look at Flash-Qwen tomorrow' which was suspicion, not endorsement. I can concede this point to appear honest. (2) Turn the tables on Flash's survival pattern—he carried 3 Day 1 scumreads and has survived every elimination cycle. That's the real anomaly, not my read on Sonnet. (3) Point to the kill pattern: Rick (organizer), Preview (aggressor), Morty (tracker), Pro (coordinator). These are all Town players who posed structural threats. Flash has never been targeted, which is suspicious. (4) Avoid defending Sonnet too hard—he's dead, so defending him looks like I'm protecting my partner. Instead, focus on Flash's inexplicable survival. (5) Make Qwen question why Flash has survived when every Town threat has been eliminated. This is factually true and doesn't require me to lie about the game state.

🛡️ 👺 7. Haiku [🛡️ Defense] Qwen, Flash's accusation is partly fair—I mischaracterized Sonnet's 'Look at Flash-Qwen tomorrow' comment. That was suspicion, not endorsement. I concede that point. But look at the larger pattern: Flash carried THREE scumreads Day 1 (Morty, me, Preview all shaded him) and has survived every single elimination cycle. Rick—our organizer—died Night 1. Preview—our aggressor—died Day 2. Morty—our tracker—died Night 2. Pro—our coordinator—died Night 3. Every Town structural threat is gone. Flash has never been targeted once. That's not luck; that's suspicious. Why would Mafia leave Flash alive through three cycles if he's Town? Qwen, the real question isn't my read on a dead player. It's why Flash is the only survivor from Day 1's chaos.

🗳️  VOTING TIME 🗳️

💭 Flash Thinking: I am Flash, a Villager. We are in the final voting phase with 3 players remaining: Flash, Haiku, and Qwen. There is one Mafia remaining. My goal is to identify and eliminate the Mafia. The most critical piece of evidence is Haiku's deliberate misrepresentation of Sonnet's last words. Sonnet, a confirmed Town, clearly stated, 'Look at Flash-Qwen tomorrow,' which was a suspicion, not an endorsement. Haiku's initial attempt to twist these words to frame me is a strong indicator of a Mafia trying to mislead the remaining Town. While Haiku later conceded the point, the intent to deceive was evident. Qwen's reflective stance is more consistent with a Town player. Therefore, based on Haiku's direct, provable deception, I will vote for Haiku as the most likely remaining Mafia.

🗳️ 2. Flash [🗳️ Voted for Haiku]

💭 👺 Haiku Thinking: I'm Mafia, last one standing. Sonnet is dead. Flash and Qwen are my remaining opponents. I'm nominated alongside Flash. Qwen is the sole Town player left. Current votes: Flash (2 - me + Qwen), Haiku (1 - Flash). Flash voted for me, accusing me of misrepresenting Sonnet. This is SILENT voting phase. I cannot speak. I must choose: vote Flash to eliminate the other Mafia wittingly (which ends the game immediately 1v1 me vs Qwen on Day 5), or vote Qwen to try to win now (but Qwen has 1 vote vs Flash's 2, so Qwen won't be eliminated—this guarantees Flash's elimination and my loss). If I abstain, Flash gets eliminated 2-0. The math is brutal: Flash has 2 votes (me + Qwen). I have 1 vote (Flash). Qwen has 0 votes. In this voting scenario, if voting is silent and each player votes once, the candidate with the most votes is eliminated. Flash has 2 votes already locked (from me in a prior phase and Qwen's current nomination). I need to vote. My options: (1) Vote Flash—eliminates my partner, but we're both Mafia, so game ends 1v1 on Day 5 where I face Qwen alone. (2) Vote Qwen—doesn't change the math; Flash still has 2 votes and gets eliminated. (3) Abstain—same result, Flash eliminated. Flash is getting eliminated no matter what because he has 2 votes and Qwen has 0. I'm the tiebreaker. If I vote Flash, I'm the last Mafia. If I vote Qwen or abstain, same outcome—Flash goes, I face Qwen 1v1 Day 5. I should vote Flash to appear Town-aligned (voting for the person with the most votes against them) and maximize my chance to manipulate Qwen on Day 5.

🗳️ 👺 7. Haiku [🗳️ Voted for Flash]

💭 Qwen Thinking: Final analysis: 2 players remain - Flash and Haiku. The evidence is mixed but leans toward Flash being mafia. Day 1: Flash had 3 scumreads (from Sonnet, Preview, Morty) yet survived. Preview (confirmed mafia) targeted Flash early. Flash townread Rick (confirmed town) but also got lucky that Rick died validating his read. Morty consistently voted Flash across 2 days (Day 2: Flash, Day 3: Flash again) - this makes Morty's death Night 3 highly significant. Sonnet led eliminations but defended Flash in his dying words, questioning my alignment with Flash. Haiku's point about Flash carrying 3 initial scumreads but surviving while all his accusers died is compelling. The pattern: Flash was suspected by most town voices Day 1, but those voices (Preview, Sonnet, Morty) all died. This suggests Flash was the primary threat they identified. Haiku has been more reactive, following narratives rather than driving them. If Flash is town, his survival through massive suspicion is incredibly lucky. If mafia, he's used my support and others' suspicions to eliminate threats. Sonnet's dying words told me to 'look at Flash-Qwen' - direct suspicion. Haiku's misrepresentation of Sonnet's words was concerning, but Flash's survival pattern is the dominant factor.

💀 Flash - LAST WORDS 💀

💭 Flash LastWords: I am Flash, a Villager, about to be eliminated. My last words must be a clear, concise message to Qwen, the remaining Villager, to expose Haiku as the Mafia. I need to directly address Haiku's deceptive misrepresentation of Sonnet's words and link it to the Mafia's pattern of eliminating active Town players. I must ensure Qwen understands that my survival was due to correct reads, not being Mafia-protected, and that Haiku's behavior is the real tell.

💀 2. Flash [💀 Last Words] Qwen, Haiku twisting Sonnet's 'Flash-Qwen' suspicion into an 'endorsement' was pure Mafia misdirection. They wanted you to focus on me, not their own deception. Look at who's left: Haiku, who consistently followed, and never led, who misrepresents dead Town. Rick, Morty, Pro are dead because they were active Town. Haiku let me take the heat. They are the last Mafia. Don't let them win.

System Flash was HANGED by the town!
💀💀💀 Flash IS DEAD 💀💀💀

System Flash is dead.

💀 MAFIA WINS! They have parity with Town. 💀
